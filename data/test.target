They discussed the functions the remote will have, including Video Plus capability and rechargeable batteries.
The group narrowed down their target marketing group to the youth market.
The Project Manager presented the new requirements that the remote not include a teletext function, that it be used only to control television, and that it include the company image in its design.
The Marketing Expert presented the findings from a lab study on user requirements for a remote control device, and discussed users' demand for a simple interface and advanced technology.
The remote will be bundled with a docking station to recharge the remote's batteries and a user-friendly instruction manual, and multiple casings will be made available.
The User Interface Designer presented his ideas for making the remote easy-to-use; he discussed using a simple design and hiding complicated features from the main interface.
The limitations of the budget will restrict the development of some features; several of the features that the group wanted to include may have to be made simpler to decrease cost.
He presented the basic components that remotes share and suggested that smaller batteries be considered in the product design.
The Industrial Designer gave his presentation on the basic functions of the remote.
The Marketing Expert will research consumers' opinions on instruction manuals.

All members felt that they interacted well and that they felt they could be creative.
The group then discussed their effectiveness as a team.
The Project Manager instructed the group to fill out a final evaluation questionnaire.
The group did not know how much the features made available to them actually cost until the prototype was constructed; their prototype design may have been different had this information been available at the beginning.
The group did express, however, that the budget was overly constraining.
There was a lack of cost information at the beginning of the project.
The group discussed the function of the prototype and decided that they should restrict the remote to television for the time being instead of allowing it to control multiple devices.

The group began a discussion about their own experiences with using remote controls and about usability features to be included in the design.
The User Interface Designer will research technical functions.
Complicated functions will be hidden in a back panel.
All participants will continue working on the remote functions.
The remote will feature a locator function that responds to clapping.
There will be a device that allows the user to enter two numbers separately to get a two-digit number in order to reduce the overall number of buttons.
The remote will feature a panel that hides complicated functions on the back of the device.
Buttons to adjust picture quality, channel tuning, and other settings will be hidden in this panel; the number pad, the channel- and volume-changing and power buttons will remain on the main interface.
The group had difficulties finding a balance between adding more features and finishing the project quickly.
The Project Manager gave the group new requirements on product features.
He presented all the necessary internal components and how they operate together.

The group discussed making their remote more user-friendly; they proposed eliminating rarely-used buttons and making it easier to skip through channels.
The group discussed how to incorporate a locator function.
He suggested incorporating a menu and an LCD screen to satisfy these requirements.
The User Interface Designer presented several existing products.
They decided that using speech recognition for the locator function only would allow them to use a simple chip.
The group discussed incorporating speech recognition and other functions to be able to decide on chip size.
He showed that the size of the chip was dependent on the type and number of additional features used.
The Industrial Designer discussed options for each of the internal components.
The Project Manager reviewed the minutes from the last meeting.
The remote will feature push buttons instead of scroll buttons, and a kinetic power supply.
The User Interface Designer and the Industrial Designer will construct the prototype.
They also decided to market the speech recognition component as a "finder function" so as not to confuse it with more advanced speech recognition components in other remote controls.
The Marketing Expert presented trends in the remote control market and the fruit and vegetable and spongy material trends in fashion.
The group decided to make the standby button in the shape of an apple.
The remote will contain a simple chip.
She expressed that buttons are often ambiguously shaped and that their remote must have an easy-to-use interface.
She presented a specialized children's remote; the group decided to focus on a basic remote that would appeal to a wide market.
The group decided to focus on a basic remote that will appeal to the widest market.
The group discussed ways to incorporate these trends.
The remote will feature the company logo, possibly in a sticker form.
They decided to make the standby button shaped like an apple, to use a rubber case and buttons, and to use a single-curved shape.
The remote will also feature a rubber case and rubber buttons, and a single-curved design.
A sample sensor was included to add speech recognition.
A simple chip is going to support the electronics of the device.
The team were reasonably satisfied with the project in terms of teamwork and creativity, although they thought that the flow of information was sometimes disjointed.
Changing the rubber case to plastic reduced the cost and allowed for an extra button-form and colour.
Finally, some new ideas were also found in the form of kinetic energy source and use of speech recognition.
However, the idea of designing a remote control seemed unexciting, especially since the requirements restricted it to TV only, and the budget was too small.
The initial cost was calculated at 13.70 Euros.
It uses kinetic energy and has a sample sensor for the speech recognition.
On a scale from 1 (true) to 7 (false) they rated it on the basis of the following criteria: fancy design (2), technological innovation (2), ease of use (1), incorporation of fashion elements (2), and brand recognition (2).
Although over budget, the team decided to evaluate this prototype before making any changes.
The case will be made of plastic.
The team were not certain to what extent the prototype satisfied recognisability of the corporate identity.
The remote will be single-curved with a cherry design on top.
On the other hand, it was argued that the special colours and form compensated for that.
The first prototype for the remote control was made of single-curved rubber with a total of 16 rubber buttons (some of them in a slide-out panel) with a cherry design on top.
The team have two questionnaires and a report on the last meeting to complete before they finish.
After changing the case material from rubber to plastic, it was debated that the loss of sponginess does affect the fancy appeal and trendiness of the remote.
The remote is going to be powered by kinetic energy.
Volume buttons will be lemon-shaped and coloured.
However, volume and channel buttons will be different from the rest.
The buttons will be made of rubber mostly in a light blue colour.
They were not certain what the colour of the company logo should be and how the logo should be displayed.
Have a locator to help find the remote when it is lost.
It should be compact, multi-functional, different in shape/color/material.
The group if not sure if they will have the budget to make the gadget multi-functional, but they would like to make one that would control basically all household machines.
Betty is the project manager, Francina is the user interface specialist, Eileen is the marketing expert, and Jeanne is the industrial designer.
The meeting opens with the group doing introductions by giving their name and role.
They also discuss a way of helping people find the remote when it is lost- a signal, whether it is a beep or light.
They also agree that it should do something different that current controls cannot do and that it should be made of different colors, materials, and shapes.
The industrial designer will work on the working design and technical function.
They seemed to agree that the remote should be compact and have a multi-purpose functions.

They do not know if their budget will allow them to include all the features they would like to such as a light emitter, clock, alarm clock, and child lock.
Their target group is basically everybody who owns a TV.
They are concerned about making the control marketable to a wide range of age groups, and have discussed making removable plastic covers so that the look is changeable.
They discuss giving the control different shapes to suit both adults and children, making the buttons various shapes, and putting a display clock on the control.
The industrial designer gives her presentation, talking about components, materials, and energy sources.
The marketing expert resumes, talking about how remotes often get lost and that a light emitter might be useful.

They discuss their target group and the possibility of removable plastic cases.
The interface designer presents, talking about the features users like on a remote and suggesting that they make the remote a T-shape and add an alarm clock function.
The meeting begins and the marketing expert starts her presentation promptly, telling them that her research shows they need a focus- it is not possible to make a device that works on the whole house.
The group would like to include voice recognition as a feature, but they are not sure about how much it would cost.
This will require further research by the industrial engineer.
The project manager opens the meeting by going over the minutes of the last meeting.
The interface specialist begins her presentation by highlighting important remote functions and showing examples of remote interfaces.
The group comments on her presentation, and then the industrial designer begins presenting.
She talks about the technical electronic components of the remote, explains how a remote works, and shows a few pictures revealing the insides of a normal remote control.
She suggests giving the remote a strong shell so it is durable, using a rechargable battery, and not adding a scroll wheel because it requires a sophisticated chip.
The marketing expert presents, talking about user preferences for a small, simple, eye-catching, cute, appealing, and functional remote.
Fruit and vegetable shapes are popular this year, so a soft, spongy remote perhaps covered with cloth could make the item marketable.
The group discusses the issues surrounding speech recognition, noting that if it is good quality it could be costly.
They about the power source and review the objectives of the product.
Their coaches will send specific instructions and answer questions.
They decided that the product should be bright, colorful, trendy in design, strong, compact, have push buttons, and contain supplement features (possibly mute button, swapping button, voice recognition).
The power source will be batteries because it is cost-effective.
The project manager closes the meeting by telling each member what task she is to complete.
The marketing expert will do the product evaluation.
The industrial designer and interface specialist will work together on a prototype using modeling clay.
The industrial designer will come up with a user interface design.
The group spent 8.20 euros on their product, but they almost forgot to factor in voice recognition, which may cost more than the 4.30 euros remaining.
They will have to settle for whatever level of quality that 4.30 euros can buy.
Light emitting diode is flourescent green.
However, while the marketing expert is doing the product evaulation the group realizes that they neglected to calculate voice recognition into the financing.
They goes over finances and are pleased to find that they are well within budget.
In their cost evaluation they got 8.20, not factoring in the voice recognition feature.
Its features will include an on/off button, two mute buttons, nine channel buttons, two buttons for increasing/decreasing the volume, two buttons for scrolling up/down channels, a menu button in the center which controls the color/sharpness/brightness of the picture, and a swapping button.
They rate their product on its shape, size, color, feel, and functionality.
Channel buttons numbered, rest of the buttons have symbols indicating function.
Their cost had been 8.20 Euros and they have  4.30 left to cover it, so they decide to settle for whatever quality it will buy.
The project manager opens the meeting by going over the minutes of the last meeting, detailing the main points of each person's presentation.
It includes a remote holder in the shape of a shell.

Using wood for the case.
The remote will have changeable case covers.
The remote will use an advanced chip.
The remote will use a conventional battery and a docking station which recharges the battery.
The revised prototype will probably be targeted to a younger one, or even across the population.
All these components were re-arranged in a revised prototype.
The project process was deemed well-structured, although everyone thought it would have been better had they known the component prices at an earlier stage.
A suggestion to target the product to a younger or perhaps more general group was met with approval.
Raising the budget was not an option, although it was promoted as an idea throughout the meeting.
The remote was also recognisable as a fashionable Real Reaction product.
Teamword and leadership were good, but room for creativity impeded by budget constraints.
It is not clear whether the budget will allow for a docking station to be produced along with the remote, as it isn't included in the costing sheet.
It was evaluated on a scale from 1 to 7 on the basis of the following criteria: fancy design (6), technological innovation (4), functionality (7), consideration of the target group (3).
The project manager will prepare the final presentation, while the rest of the group will fill in a questionnaire.
One rechargable battery, single-curve form and plastic case, brought the total cost to 17 Euros.
The non-standard interface (few buttons, scrollwheel) makes the remote unsuitable for older people - the original target group.
Along with buttons for numbers, channel selector, volume, mute, on-off, teletext, and subtitles, the prototype included an LCD screen and a help button for functional information.
The case will be plastic and will be made in single-curve form.
It was suspected that many would not know how to use a scrollwheel, even though it does resemble a radio tuning button.
The remaining buttons were one for channel selection, one for volume (both assisted by the scrollwheel), teletext, on-off and the help button.
To reduce this cost, it was decided to replace most buttons with a scrollwheel.
In the detailed design meeting the team created a prototype.
Standard buttons like the ones for teletext shortcuts were considered superfluous.
An LCD screen will be providing functional information, and context tips when using the scrollwheel.
The Project Manager instructed the Industrial Designer to work on the working design and the User Interface Designer to research the technical functions.

He also explains the various components, materials, and energy sources of a remote, giving preference to a remote with multifunctional buttons and without a receiver.
The interface specialist presents, talking about the possible components of the remote and concluding that the remote should be simple and accessible without too much functionality.
The marketing expert explains various user preferences and complaints about remotes as well as different interests among age groups.
He prefers that they aim users from ages 16-45, improve the most-used functions, and make a placeholder for the remote.
The industrial designer begins explaining the working design.
He talks about existing products, most of which use infared since it is simple and cost-effective.
When this functional design meeting opens the project manager tells  the group about the project restrictions he received from management by email.
The marketing expert is first to present, summarizing user requirements data from a questionaire given to 100 respondents.
They will fill out the questionaire
They will receive specific instructions for the next meeting by email.
