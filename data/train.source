well this is the kick-off meeting for our our project. so we're designing a new remote control and, as you can see it's supposed to be original, trendy and user friendly. and so there are three different stages to the design. So we're gonna have like individual work and then a meeting about it. And repeat that process three times. So you get to draw your favourite animal and sum up your favourite characteristics of it. My favourite animal is like A beagle., right, well basically high priority for any animal for me is that they be willing to take a lot of physical affection from their family. And, yeah that they have lots of personality Well, my favourite animal would be a monkey. Then they're small cute and furry, and I kind of like whales. They come in and go eat everything in sight. M my favourite animal is my own dog at home. he's very friendly and cheery and always pleased to see you,
so according to the brief we're gonna be selling this remote control for twenty five Euro, And we don't want it to cost any more than twelve fifty Euros, so fifty percent of the selling price. but selling price is is that wholesale or retail? I imagine it probably is our sale actually because it's probably up to the the the retailer to sell it for whatever price they want.. I mean do you think the fact that it's going to be sold internationally will have a bearing on how we design it at all? Like how much does, you know, a remote control cost. Well twenty five Euro, I mean that's that's about like eighteen pounds or something, thi is this gonna to be like the premium product kinda thing or so I don't know how how good a remote control that would get you..
as well as characters, different keypad styles and s symbols. Well right away I'm wondering if there's th th, like with D_V_D_ players, if there are zones. 'cause you have more complicated characters like European languages, then you need more buttons. I'm thinking the price might might appeal to a certain market in one region, whereas in another it'll be different, so thinking, 'kay trendy probably means something other than just basic, But yeah, I suppose it has to look kind of cool and gimmicky. So extra functionalities. So, like, I wonder if we might add something new to the to the remote control market, so in function one of the priorities might be to combine as many uses Right, so do you think that should be like a main design aim of our remote control d you know, do your your satellite and your regular telly and your V_C_R_ and everything? maybe what we could use is a sort of like a example of a successful other piece technology is palm palm pilots. W You get those ones where you can, if you like, whistle or make a really high pitched noise they beep. Maybe we could think about how, could be more, you know, streamlined. S Maybe like a touch screen or something? Or whatever would be technologically reasonable. I mean you probably want some kind of unique selling point of it, I think one factor would be production cost.
I mean do you think the fact that it's going to be sold internationally will have a bearing on how we design it at all? Well right away I'm wondering if there's th th, like with D_V_D_ players, if there are zones.
And we don't want it to cost any more than twelve fifty Euros, so fifty percent of the selling price.
are we at ma right now on the assumption that our television remote control may have features which go beyond the television? Or are we keeping sort of like a a design commitment to television features? So extra functionalities. so in function one of the priorities might be to combine as many uses
so inbetween now and then, as the industrial designer, you're gonna be working on you know the actual working design of it
for user interface, technical functions,
and marketing executive, you'll be just thinking about what it actually what, you know, what requirements it has to has to fulfil
so according to the brief we're gonna be selling this remote control for twenty five Euro, Well twenty five Euro, I mean that's that's about like eighteen pounds or something,
so I believe the the advanced functions should maybe be hidden in a drawer, and also think maybe a little bit about sorta w w what would just wanna be acc easily accessible. so that for the user it's very clear what they want to do where they go. For example if we had audio controls, those could be something people set up very rarely. Maybe they're un they're they're they're in a little area but covered up, things like channel and volume are used all the time, so we just have them right out on top, so maybe we need to think about having three or more groupings of controls, you know like one which are just the the habitual ones that should be right within your natural grip. and then others that are concealed. So it you wanna group all the different kind of types of functions together, you know.
Well I think I think es essentially what we're doing right now is we're categorising. We're saying well we want this to be a product that offers all the sort of more tricky features but we want them to be in another area? we need to find out exactly what we have to have and after that we can add things if they're possible. Well, one one way I would look at this would be that we a approach the different controls in terms of like control types, so that for the user it's very clear what they want to do where they go. and also think maybe a little bit about sorta w w what would just wanna be acc easily accessible. For example if we had audio controls, those could be something people set up very rarely. Maybe they're un they're they're they're in a little area but covered up, things like channel and volume are used all the time, so we just have them right out on top, so maybe we need to think about having three or more groupings of controls, you know like one which are just the the habitual ones that should be right within your natural grip. and then others that are concealed. So it you wanna group all the different kind of types of functions together, you know. Another thing that you were saying about categorising the controls? maybe I could suggest we we break them down into three simple categories. One would be audio controls, one would be video controls, and the other one would be a device. I mean like so what we could have is like three buckets, right, where we could throw things into, and then from there decide whether it's basic, or it's non-basic. okay, great. shall we agree for sake of sort of clarity and when we when we r resume that we'll u use this idea David's proposed, where we think of these three sort of buckets and anything anything we discuss about them is sort of, okay, we're talking about this. Yeah, yeah I think
Okay, so fifteen to thirty five, look fairly young. Are we all happy about the idea of aiming the product at the fifteen to thirty five bracket? Yeah, that's good.
one is that we want something that's high-tech but we want it to seem easy. And in spite of the primitive side of it and the very high-tech side, we want it to just be an appealing piece of equipment in people's hands. so yeah, I guess just things to think about are you know like the fact it's gotta look good,
then I don't think rechargeable is something we should you know, we really need to care about. Okay, so just stick to to regular
because I mean it it's tried and tested intra-red, so we could stay with tha
they've also suggested that we we only use the remote control to control the television, not the V_C_R_, D_V_D_ or anything else. So, we're just gonna keep it simple and it'll just control the T_V_.
so I believe the the advanced functions should maybe be hidden in a drawer, Maybe they're un they're they're they're in a little area but covered up, and then others that are concealed. 'Cause what what I'm I'd be a bit worried about is if someone was h had previously developed habits of expecting to control surround sound or this and that with their controller and then and then they, you know, w they get ours and w it's doesn't have that. is it not an option still that we include some things just as a sort of under like sort of under a door or some
which is the The first one is that the company's decided that teletext is outdated because of how popular the internet is. so we don't really need to consider that in the functionality of the of the remote control.
if that's possible we might consider getting into it. do you think then voice recognition is something we should really seriously consider? It does it does fit with the market that we're sort of identifying, and 'cause you know, there needs to be some kind of selling point to it. if we are going to include speech recognition, it's kind of between fifteen and thirty five seems to be like a really high response to that. So they'll not sh not shy away from something quite high-tech. so shall we make the decision to include speech recognition I I think one thing we should try not to avoid is not to say we have to use speech recognition right now, because, based on what you've go y everybody's saying, right, you want something simple. Speech recognition might not be the simplest thing for somebody to use. Could it be an on off thing? but what I'm saying is that we're we're trying to lock ourselves into a s particular kind of technology, rather than focusing on on exactly what are the features that we're gonna say, and then, you know, say speech recognition is good for this, speech recognition is not good for this. but at end of the day we don't look at the technology, but we look at the function first. is if we make it speech reco if we incorporate speech recognition, that's appealing to people maybe with a physical disability as well. And also it helps in terms of people not losing this, I reckon one problem with speech recognition is I've actually seen one of them used and the technology that was in that one wasn't particularly amazing, so you end up yelling at the control for hours. Do you think maybe we need like further advances in that kind of area until it's worthwhile incorporating it though? I think it'd probably quite expensive to put in.
I mean so far I've got on and off, switch the channel up and down, and put the volume up and down. and then actual numbers for channels as well, yeah., so so far, just to recap you've got volume and channel control and There's on and off, volume and channel, and skip to certain channels with the numbers. I think we just say that it was gonna be the the most basic stuff possible. on off, up and down channels, up and down volume and skip to a channel.
And the other thing was that the company want the corporate colour and slogan to be implemented in the new design.
Well I think it's a valid point. I mean like the one on the left looks quite quite complicated, so I see I see why yo you know you might prefer the simpler design, you know you get a lot of remote controls where you kind of flip the thing open,, do we have any functions that we'd want on it? I mean so far I've got on and off, switch the channel up and down, and put the volume up and down. and then actual numbers for channels as well, yeah., you say that's a h a required one or a requested one? God, I wou I would say that's required, I mean there's no way anybody's gonna buy a remote control these days when if you can't actually individually select channels, any kind of like display controls at all do you think we need to worry about, Well I think I think es essentially what we're doing right now is we're categorising. We're saying well we want this to be a product that offers all the sort of more tricky features but we want them to be in another area? we need to find out exactly what we have to have and after that we can add things if they're possible. There's on and off, volume and channel, and skip to certain channels with the numbers., so so far, just to recap you've got volume and channel control and Well, one one way I would look at this would be that we a approach the different controls in terms of like control types, so that for the user it's very clear what they want to do where they go. and also think maybe a little bit about sorta w w what would just wanna be acc easily accessible. For example if we had audio controls, those could be something people set up very rarely. Maybe they're un they're they're they're in a little area but covered up, things like channel and volume are used all the time, so we just have them right out on top, so maybe we
I dunno whether this is for good or for bad but there'll be a lot of kind of redundancy in the in the the issues and the the the things. what I've already started doing is cr I created a slide in in my presentation here so that we kind of think well what's the cumulative effect of what we've taken from your ideas and and mine, Obviously obviously what you've just told me what you've just told me impacts a lot on what like market research that that I've been hard to know what where your role ends, yeah. Before I bring this up what I'll just say is what I've what I've done is tried to collect some information so that I can then relay this to to you guys so that it's now becomes a collective thing. And then kind of lead us in the direction of deciding, 'kay what what are our options, what should we decide So what I basically got is I just looked into some information and sort of th tried to think about how how we could review it and what kind of decisions we could take away from it So I'm thinking here about primarily about customer needs, and what are issues with with existing products. and also about try and connect that as you see with the company vision So this is what I've found here,, users dislike the look and feel of current remote controls. Most people find them ugly. the vast majority would spend more money for it to look fancy as well, we'll see later, the vast majority would spend more money for slightly more intuitive control, such as voice recognition. most people use only a f a very slim portion of all the controls. they tend to use the most simple controls if for me this is sorta like three different different inspirations, you know, one is that we want something that's high-tech but we want it to seem easy. And in spite of the primitive side of it and the very high-tech side, we want it
just want to tell you that you have three new requirements, which is the The first one is that the company's decided that teletext is outdated because of how popular the internet is. so we don't really need to consider that in the functionality of the of the remote control. they've also suggested that we we only use the remote control to control the television, not the V_C_R_, D_V_D_ or anything else. I think the worry is that if the project becomes too complex then it'll affect how long it takes us to get it into into production, the time to market. So, we're just gonna keep it simple and it'll just control the T_V_. And the other thing was that the company want the corporate colour and slogan to be implemented in the new design. I'm not entirely sure what the corporate colour is. It might be yellow, because there seems to be a lot of yellow everywhere. And the slogan, like the actual written slogan, or just to embody the idea of the slogan? th because on the the company website, what does it say 'Bout putting the fashion in electronics. I mean do they Is that something they want actually written on it, 'cause it's quite long. So those are the three things, just not to worry about teletext, only control the T_V_, and and incorporate the colour and slogan of the company.
Well, one of the things that we have to decide on by the end of the meeting is who we're gonna be who's our our target audience, our target market., so if we want something that that looks good and is easy to use, but has y is fairly powerful product, whatever, who do we really want to aim that at? Where's the money, maybe. Yeah, who wou who would have the money to spend. it's somebody who's not gonna just use the remote that comes with their telly, I suppose,, I think it'll be the mid range to the high end market, in terms of people. so maybe not the high end range, but maybe middle, middle up-ish. Mostly focused around the twenty five age group. Sort of young professional, kind of. Mm-hmm I think we are gonna have to narrow it down, I I think twenty five to thirty five is is is fair to add that in as a group as well So these are people who are gadgety, right? So they'll not sh not shy away from something quite high-tech.
so this is the technical functions design. to do the the design I have I've had a look online, I've had a look at the homepage, I've had a look at the previous products to see what they offer, having a look at the existing products, I found out that it tends to come in sort of two extremes, there's either a very complicated one that's got lots of buttons, lots of colours, very confusing, you don't know what you're doing. in that case the the labelling tends to be very bad. here the button there and there. That one's perg and that one's prog, and it doesn't really tell you what it does., not sure if you had a a look at the other control in that example. it's a very simple one. It's got only the basic functions but it's the same size as the the hard to use one. it looked a bit clunky. They're very big and not very much use for buttons. and it's just very hard to access the advanced functions., my own preferences, I prefer the the clunky one. so I believe the the advanced functions should maybe be hidden in a drawer, So, now I'd like to ask for your preferences. Which which is the clunky one, the one on left or on the right?.., the clunky one is the one on the right. I think it's supposed to be the same size, but it's got much fewer buttons. and then others that are concealed.
for our Industrial Designer, you're gonna be thinking about the components concept.
User Interface Designer gonna be thinking about our user interface,
Well this is just the working design. I guess I try to define like what we're doing now, but we're we can't n we haven't narrowed down exactly what the things we're trying to fulfil, like I think back in the back of our minds we know what the basics are. Has to change channels, has to change volume, but in like specifics, right, which one of the basics are you trying to target. so I'll go into the diagram first. It just explains how the process goes through, from the basic technology point of view, the basic steps that you need you need some power source. 'Kay, a battery or something, to keep it going. and that power source is important because it ties you down to how long the device will last. Like for example, voice recognition, right. That might be constrained because that you might need to power a microphone, so that's one perhaps constraint there. Th Okay, the basic thing is there's a user interface You know, and that picks up an input from a user, a series of logic has to decide what the user is telling the device, and then it needs to be able to send the signal out to the device itself like voice recognition, right, if it's something which is important then we just add more power rather than having a thing that we don't have enough power. maybe you you wanna go back to what the functions are? Well, do you wan do you wanna finish up your your whole presentation then? Yeah, w I'm done. you have a transmitter, an input device, logic chip, Since we're on the topic of the technology, are there any like what are our options? Is this the only way that we go about it, or are there other thin, these these aren't technology options in that sense. a basic principles and basic components that are needed. So each component represents one function, but I think the basic functions are the logic, the transmitter, and the receiver, okay, and the power are things that you
I'm just gonna just recap what I said at the start, was that the the whole point of this meeting was to f absolutely finalise who we're gonna aim this at, Are we all happy about the idea of aiming the product at the fifteen to thirty five bracket? Yeah, that's good. I think we just say that it was gonna be the the most basic stuff possible. on off, up and down channels, up and down volume and skip to a channel. and also the funct the the actual functions of what it's gonna do. And is it going to include any of the the more advanced features, is it not an option still that we include some things just as a sort of under like sort of under a door or some Yeah, it's as optional functions. 'Cause what what I'm I'd be a bit worried about is if someone was h had previously developed habits of expecting to control surround sound or this and that with their controller and then and then they, you know, w they get ours and w it's doesn't have that. Another thing that you were saying about categorising the controls? maybe I could suggest we we break them down into three simple categories. One would be audio controls, one would be video controls, and the other one would be a device. I mean like so what we could have is like three buckets, right, where we could throw things into, and then from there decide whether it's basic, or it's non-basic. okay, great. Device is basically anything which we can't categorise, right. shall we agree for sake of sort of clarity and when we when we r resume that we'll u use this idea David's proposed, where we think of these three sort of buckets and anything anything we discuss about them is sort of, okay, we're talking about this. Yeah, yeah I think that's definitely a good idea. so you're gonna have audio which is gonna be like you know your bass settings and actual volume hi And then video is anything
and marketing you're gonna be thinking about trend watching.
Feel like fruit.
I know we're gonna have like rubber buttons
Can we get a strong enough battery to power a light? We're gonna need to put in a really good battery so people don't have to charge their r remote control every few days. energy what do you think that's suggesting we're how we're powering the thing? I really like the idea of this kinetic thing where you'd have the back-up of the battery, but have have kinetic power,
and when the corporate colour is yellow, I mean maybe we could think about about the colour of the whole product being yellow maybe what we could do is t th think about a concept which touches b back to the on the the colour, So for the look and feel to seem coherent and not just sorta bits and bits and pieces of of concept and technology or or whatever or fashion, then we should have it kind of come back to one thing that we kind of all sorta can visualize. So I reckon it'd look quite nice if we just had this here, had a sorta background yellow, and then have sort of a nice bold colour for the buttons. And the other thing was can we think of any way of getting the slogan into this thing? and that we've got like the the l slogan somewhere like on the casing at the side,
I'd quite like a sort of snowman type shape. so a p sort of larger bit sits in your hand, and then you got maybe another bubble at the top for just any other function you need.
I'll just just recap on the minutes from the last meeting. decided on our our target group being fifteen to thirty five, and we decided that it was gonna be non-rechargeable battery-powered, that we're gonna group our audio-visual and other functions into into those categories,. And I told you guys about the three new requirements about ignoring teletext, ignoring everything except the T_V_, and trying to incorporate the the corporate colour and slogan.
basically what I wanna do here, before we get into it too far, is I want to show you all the background information I have that I think we need to acknowledge if we want this to be successful. Okay so out of different figures and ratings ob of people in general, consumers in general, the number one thing that was found was that the br t television remote control, a fancy look and feel, okay, and not, it specified, not a functional look or or feel, b f f fancy. Number two was that it be innovative. and third priority for ease of use, is that I think what we should think about is how the about how the innovation contributes to the look and feel, and not so much to the functionality of it. top European fashion trend that I read about says there's this emerging theme of fruit and vegetables, okay, especially in clothes and furniture. So my my feeling is that we w do want to observe this trend, And then in terms of m material trends are for things to be soft and spongy and sort of, you might say ergonomic or or friendly to handle, And then at the end there are vibrant natural colours softness in materials, shape, and function, so I'm thinking if we imagine that we're taking some of the features of a Mac iPod and we're then making it s more of like a more of like a comfortable type of we think of some kind of a thin theme that unifies it all, sorta like a marketing identity. Like the ones the ones which I'm most fond of in terms of giving like a theme to it would be like like lemon or something like that, Maybe like it could light up in different colours or something or or people could buy the buy the control and then it comes with different like covers or something so.
The fact that it talks to you, I mean it might be quite cool if when you first start using it it says, what is it, putting fashion into electronics or something, I think that'd probably scare me.
there's a wee bit of discussion about the other existing ones there, so I've taken the suggestions from them and tried to incorporate them into this we're looking for suggestions on size th size of control and the buttons, and whereabout the buttons should be located on the control. the shape of the control, what I found from the research is that most the current controls are just basically big bricks with loads of buttons all over them. they're not very attractive to look at, and they're not very comfortable to hold, and they're very easily lost. for instance, the stand-by button isn't always red,
also would that work if we wanted to incorporate an L_C_D_ display, where would we put that? Do we need an L_C_D_ display? It's bound to increase the cost of it a lot, I would've thought. what would we what would we achieve from it? And the th the thing I could see it helping with would be if it was somehow connected with listings. So as you scroll through, 'cause we said we might have a jog dial, so as you scroll through your stations you can y it actually tells you what it is. I think that will be a problem because we don't have an input device to get the listings into it,
I would say no need for a talk-back.
The buttons should be large. They should be easy to press, very comfortable. so the up volume button looks like it should be a down volume button, that's kinda confusing. should avoid s things like that. if the the corporate colour scheme allows it we should have a very bright colour so that it can be easily identified anywhere. any extra features we add beyond the basic ones should be m hidden, if we did decide to go for voice activation there sh should always be a button as alternative, we should definitely avoid the big square block look. and they've said th the voice control can now talk back if you ask it a question. So it sh it could be good to have them confirm any action you take I don't know where the slogan should go, or really what the slogan is. I think it's, fashion into electronics. And we don't know how flexible the colour scheme is.
but because the case is transparent so it gives it a little bit of a glow, doesn't make it freaky. S so like cur slightly transparent case, so it's yellow, like tinted yellow, but you can maybe see through it. Or or there might be a light running through it like a mouse. Okay so so backlighting, that would be good. you know a a glowing a a glowing yellow type case where the yellow is showable, and that we've got like the the l slogan somewhere like on the casing at the side,
Yeah I think the jog dial, what if it was flat and you just spun it,
like you said time to market was a problem, and how many components are physically in there in cost. And the power is basically a factor of that. and the lower components, the power, the logic, the transmitter, and the infrared, they affect you in terms of the size of your device, So I guess three things, cost, complexity, and the size. I'm not very sure about the voice thing 'cause I got another email and it was in fact quite sketchy on what n the voice options are. it said it could talk to you, but it never said anything about being able to listen. I it said something about a sensor but never clarified that. Okay so your basic components are buttons, okay and you have a wheel available, like a mouse scroll wheel, okay there's an L_C_D_ display, Okay then there's how the case actually looks. It can actually be flat or it can be curved, and then the different types of materials that you can use, I don't think you can use them in a combination, I think plastic and rubber would be fine, but plastic, rubber, and wood, the rubber was a restriction on the kind of power source you could use, but the titanium had a different kind of things on the shape of the thing, but you know it might be easier from a cost perspective and a complexity just to use one. and the other components are logic chips, again I'll I'll go back to the component chips. The com how complex or how easy the logic is, it depends on how many functions you have on the on the unit I don't think the logic chip has a issue about size 'cause they should be about the same size. Power consumption should be about the same. and the other thing is the power options. the first one is a standard battery. Okay the second one I think is more of a gimmick then actually a useable thing, it's a wind-up you know, a crank. I think that's more of a look and
So as you scroll through, 'cause we said we might have a jog dial, so as you scroll through your stations you can y it actually tells you what it is. Could we use like a jog dial, like a nice just sort of round, somewhere on it where you just roll it? The question is when you're rolling it, how do you wanna roll it? 'Cause in a mouse your hand's in a position to roll it, whereas the other thing about having it jog dial this way, it tends to get moved accidentally. Can you imagine you have to scroll a lot. it might work for volume, and maybe some of the brightness controls and stuff like that, but not for channels right. Yeah I think the jog dial, a slide, because then you you don't have to put the hand.
and also t plastic I've seen can get really textured, so you can get plastics that actually feel soft in your hand.
We're gonna need to put in a really good battery so people don't have to charge their r remote control every few days. that's why I think the option of the the kinetic thing which basically means as long as you shake it like a watch, like an automatic watch But are people gonna wanna shake their movie controller? it's probably sensitive enough when you fiddle it. I think we could go for like maybe not a p a fruit shape but a very sort of curvy type shape. you could have the same sort of texture and colour as a fruit. probably something that s sits in your hand comfortably, sort of feels right in your hand. So something quite curvy? about how if you have a bright colour you'll not lose it so much. and when the corporate colour is yellow, I mean maybe we could think about about the colour of the whole product being yellow So for the look and feel to seem coherent and not just sorta bits and bits and pieces of of concept and technology or or whatever or fashion, then we should have it kind of come back to one thing that we kind of all sorta can visualize. maybe what we could do is t th think about a concept which touches b back to the on the the colour, 'Cause I I I was kinda thinking about as well you know how you get these shock resistant mobile phones, and they're plastic but then also have like rubber on the outside, and it kinda feels it feels kind of warmer to the touch. It feels a bit more comfortable, and maybe we could incorporate plastic and rubber into it. I'd quite like a sort of snowman type shape. so a p sort of larger bit sits in your hand, and then you got maybe another bubble at the top for just any other function you need. So I reckon it'd look quite nice if we just had this here, had a sorta background yellow, and then have sort of a nice
I know that the designers are gonna be working with Play-doh on that. the next meeting's gonna be in thirty minutes,
I think we could go for like maybe not a p a fruit shape but a very sort of curvy type shape. So something quite curvy?
I'd quite like a sort of snowman type shape. so a p sort of larger bit sits in your hand, and then you got maybe another bubble at the top for just any other function you need.
Square buttons? Yeah
So we're w w quite far over. something's gonna have to go. we're at sixteen point eight and
No. Do we have kinetic as well? And that's because of cost restraints is it? Yep.
We've got push buttons as well.
The other thing could be that you could take away the L_C_D_ panel and the advanced chip together,
so when we scroll we need just some way to get the T_V_ to respond,
answering the question in those terms I'd say that actually there's sort of a tease of creativity We're told okay think in terms of style and look and feel and technology, but build something for twelve and a half pounds, so actually the creativity was more more of like a a f sort of a f formality then an actual The constraints do come in very fast. it's it is quite a lot of fun t to go and then you have sort of hit the end then go right, gotta cut everything out 'cause we don't have enough money., reckon that was a bit hard because we could only discuss things in the meeting. If we could just go up to somebody outside the meeting and have a quick talk with them, that would've been a lot easier. I think the tools that they were given, the tool set that were given to us are fancy but they don't support collaboration, I think that's the word. I mean sort of taking upon that idea, w the way I see this i is that it's the the s the structure in which we've we've approached this whole task is quite contrary to the p principle of teamwork because the the tasks were d d sort of divided, and then the work went on in isolation, the w main one for me is that the process na in a natural f context would not have been interrupted by this necessity to discommunicate ourselves from each other. well you know it's kind of s hard to keep f working forward on a team a team based project when when you're told you must now work away from your team. I really thi i I think maybe if we'd like all been working in the one room, and they just said you know like every hour or something everybody make sure yo you know just have a have a short meeting and then just c
so then these just become normal coloured buttons,
out of forty nine with with zero being the highest. We are at two, seven, eight, ten, fifteen point five. So it's pretty good.
well next up then, because we've done finance, is the project evaluation. well do you wanna just individually say what you think about about these four points and Well d do you feel though that that you were able to have quite a lot of creative input into the thing? Yeah, yeah it feels as though the creativity goes on when we leave, and then we come here and then we kind of put out our ideas and then, you know. But I don't I don't think it means the room as in this room. so actually the creativity was more more of like a a f sort of a f formality then an actual We're told okay think in terms of style and look and feel and technology, but build something for twelve and a half pounds, answering the question in those terms I'd say that actually there's sort of a tease of creativity I think another point is that the meetings are more brainstorming sessions than meetings, The constraints do come in very fast. it's it is quite a lot of fun t to go and then you have sort of hit the end then go right, gotta cut everything out 'cause we don't have enough money. and I think the fact that we're wearing these things restricts it it it does actually you know affect how, w whether you feel comfortable to communicate. and and the time the time given also restricts In in reality I think here the the different elements of leadership such as the the original b briefing and then the personal coach and the and then you know having having you with your the meeting agenda is actually quite a quite a quite a con confining framework to work within. And so it is leadership almost to the point of sort of disempowering the the the team member, so But it's not bad leadership, it's just sort of s fairly strong, you know. I think the interactions are very structured. So you think maybe a little too controlling or Yeah, oh yeah, without without
No. Do we have kinetic as well? And that's because of cost restraints is it? Yep. I think we're gonna have to skip the rubber. so then these just become normal coloured buttons, And now we're under budget.
I've reviewed all of the the points of discussion from the beginning, and used that as a criteria of evaluation for the for the current design th or the plan, So to sort of b bring together two things, sort of design goals and also the market research that we had, when we rate this, one is v high in in succeeding or fitting to our original aim and seven is low, and we've been asked to to collectively rate this, So the first one, stylish look and feel. I rate that pretty highly. Okay let's go with five then. Let's go with two point five then. high tech innovation. so we've had to remove a few of our features we wanted, but jog-dial Yeah about three, okay. Style reflects a fruit inspired colour, design. Okay, the blue the blue colours and don't re don't actually represent the colour, the the yellow is more representative of the colour, so we'll go two. and design is simple to use, simple in features. I mean I'd give that nearly a one., soft and spongy, have we achieved that? We've used mostly plastic in the end so it's going to be quite a bit of a compromise for price. Yeah I think it's about five. logo, we've got it in there, haven't we? And it's within budget, yep.
we said we were gonna have a snowman shaped remote control with no L_C_D_ display, no need for talk-back, it was hopefully gonna be kinetic power and battery with rubber buttons, maybe backlighting the buttons with some internal L_E_D_s to shine through the casing, hopefully a jog-dial, and incorporating the slogan somewhere as well., there are a few changes we've made., well look at the expense sheet, and it turned to be quite a lot expensive to have open up and have lots of buttons and stuff inside, this is gonna be an L_C_D_ screen, just a a very very basic one, very small with access to the menu through the the scroll wheel and confirm, apart from that, it's just pretty much the same as we discussed last time. the advanced functions are still hidden from you, but they're hidden in the sense that they're not in use. they're in the L_C_D_ panel and the jog-dial? The L_C_D_ panel just displays functionally what you're doing. If you're using an advanced function right, like c brightness, contrast, whatever, it will just say It might even be one, a bit more complex L_C_D_ panel with pictures like maybe the sun or the, you know, the the symbols of the various functions. That's a number pad. Where are we gonna have the slogan? just like right inside there. Well we want the other buttons to be big enough to push easily with a finger so we reckon maybe that'll be about the same size as the palm of your hand. So we're talking about ten centimetres. We're gonna have again the the sort of the foggy yellow from last time that lit up when you pushed the button. this button, because it's red it's sort of very prominent, we're gonna use it as it can be the power button if you hold it for maybe two seconds it'll send a stand-by signal. apart from that it's gonna be used as a confirm button for the L_C_D_ screen Oh we've discussed how h high it is, but how wide is it? be about th
We can now have a little look at the the Excel sheet and price listing, and see if we need to if we need to rethink anything at all. for this first part here power-wise, have we got battery? We need an advanced chip I think, yep. We've got push buttons as well. Okay let's just be safe and put like say four buttons for that one. The other thing could be that you could take away the L_C_D_ panel and the advanced chip together, It It needs to be more than one big button because if you open up your phone, underneath there's actually one button underneath, it's just that the panel itself is a single panel. or the colours, you could take away s colours for th for the buttons. No can do.
The other thing could be that you could take away the L_C_D_ panel and the advanced chip together,
So we want double-curved?
I think the the only ones that I've seen that you buy are the sort of one for all type things Yeah the universal ones. Yeah. So presumably that might be an idea to put into. so I thought maybe something like if you lose it and you can whistle,
So presumably that might be an idea to put into. so maybe we could think about colour? so I thought maybe something like if you lose it and you can whistle, What do we think a good size would be for this?
So you want me to look at shapes and everything you said? Shapes and colours and basically how to make it attractive.
So you do the looking around at other remote controls.
So you do the looking around at other remote controls. and you could look into basically how how it's made I_E_ like how you make it all in one, how what sort of materials are available to you whatever. So you want me to look at shapes and everything you said? Shapes and colours and basically how to make it attractive.
so I thought maybe something like if you lose it and you can whistle, What do we think a good size would be for this? Kind of, maybe more like a P_D_A_ kind of, just hand held,
and you could look into basically how how it's made I_E_ like how you make it all in one, how what sort of materials are available to you whatever.
and I jotted down some notes as to what are the b needs and what kind of novel features we can add to differentiate our product from the others. And a novel feature which we just brought up was this this automatic speech recognition feature or noise detection feature for when you lose the remote, there could be a little microphone on it, and any noise over a certain threshold it'll pick up as a a distress signal from you and it'll beep back and say you know oh here I am or something of this sort. But sure surely that would have to be sort of specific rather than above a threshold 'cause if you had a loud movie on you're likely to get it beeping back at you. and then as for the user interface it should be trendy, right, so more low tech and not too many buttons. So I think I I missed the budget thing, it was fifty million Euros? so we're making that at twelve and a half Euros a time. Well I guess more realistically then, we need a product that's got some kinda nifty outer casing, An energy source which'd probably just be your regular batteries cheap plastic, you know, Would it be possible to have the rechargeable idea? Yeah, yeah, we could do that too. Or a little base station or something,. the canonical user interface for these would be just a bunch of buttons, but since we're a cutting edge company, we of course will have alternatives like speech recognition, whistling recognition and rocket power and lastly the transmission interface is, just some engineering thing you don't have to worry about. so here's you know, a great schematic that my apprentice designer gave me. personal preferences, I think programmable options which just require a small amount of memory, just so the user can put in their favourite channels and maybe their preferred volume settings so that when they turn it on it's not blasting. And the, the bells and whistles that we mentioned you know, they take more budgeting, more technical
I'm concerned with w what effect the apparatus should have on the user I want to point out that our motto, put the fashion in electronics, the basic that was the basic function to send messages to the television set. but I've got some pictures here of some leading ones. These are two leading remote controls at the moment. I mean this one's got loads of buttons,, personally I prefer this one just because it's looks easier use, it's a bit more sleek with more of this silver stuff,, well I think we need to l I think the ergonomics is quite important, And I thought not too edgy and like a box, so I think what we can miss out on the buttons we can make up for in design and and how nice it looks. was maybe a bit of a gimmick to set us apart from other people, like glow-in-the-dark Easy finder with the a whistle function or something, or rechargeable station because it's a pain when you run out of batteries. and I was just curious to know, have we done any research into how many people can whistle? is that a function we want in the remote? you could have the basically instead of a whistle if it's got the voice recognition you could have it just, you know, where are you?. a much easier thing is just any loud noise like clapping, shouting, you know, and then, what would the response be? It beeps back at you or something?
Okay, so, we have to decide on which functions we're going to actually have. speech recognition potentially, flat screen interface, L_C_D_ interface we also want to limit the number of buttons so I mean a a the sort of inkling I'm getting from little bits of web chatter that I'm getting sent is that they're quite interested in a T_F_T_ display, interactive display. glow in the dark, is that sort of with a light inside it or is it sort of glow in the dark material? But if we add speech recognition as well as glow in the dark then both these factors will help their locating the remote control, I know of no products that use speech recognition well. but what about something that's built into the T_V_ that you can press and it'll send out a little signal that that will activate the remote control starts to beep. You just say you know, whatever you whatever you want the remote for, you just shout your command to it and it would do it for you if it's within you know, within hearing range. I like the whole sort of remote feedback thing. we can still use the glow in the dark as a gimmick essentially, and we can have sort of a a a trimming as well, of the glow in the dark material, just as gimmickyness. there's a good chance the the T_F_T_ screen would break or get damaged. So we'll stick with sort of programmability for the buttons that we do have. I think we're gonna scratch the speech recognition as a bit of a Oh no it's it's much cheaper than the T_F_T_, it's just a microphone and some some integrated circuits. so we'll go with speech recognition, yeah?, speech recognition, limited buttons, organic design. Glow in dark. if it's not too expensive s I think it's a good gimmick. And also, integrating the, remember to integrate the logo and the s slogan. What I thought as well about the material is maybe not this kind of material, but maybe more like this kind of rubbery
Right, also so a notice I got not very long before the meeting, We had that to dis-include teletext because it's become outdated, and everybody uses the internet anyway. it's only for the television, and instead of colours and sorta colour options, they want corporate colour and slogan somehow implemented in the new design., everything, all their sort of you know the corporate website and everything's yellow. And the logo the sort of slogan we put the fa fashion in electronics
And I'll see if I can argue with boss about putting the We put the fashion in electronics
we also want to limit the number of buttons glow in the dark, is that sort of with a light inside it or is it sort of glow in the dark material? we can still use the glow in the dark as a gimmick essentially, and we can have sort of a a a trimming as well, of the glow in the dark material, just as gimmickyness. So we'll stick with sort of programmability for the buttons that we do have. so we'll go with speech recognition, yeah?, speech recognition, limited buttons, organic design. Glow in dark. if it's not too expensive s I think it's a good gimmick. And also, integrating the, remember to integrate the logo and the s slogan.
, yes, I have to look at the market potential for this product, then the methodology I adopted to find out all this was market survey. Seventy five percent of users they do find it that the remote controls available in the market are ugly. we have to take care of this fact also like our design, should be appropriate, should be good looking for the consumers. and even the good thing about this is that eighty percent of users they are willing to pay high pay more for this good looking remote controls also. but rather than those having more functions in the remote controls we should emphasise what actually consumer want, what they operate, rather than making it too complicated. Because mostly it has been found that fifty percent of the users they use only ten percent of the buttons, If we look at the costs whether the consumers they are willing to pay more for speech recognition in a remote control or not, we can find that they up to a thirty five years age group we have a very good disliking for this this point, like for speech recognition in a remote control. because it will definitely enhance our sales in this ag in this particular age group from fifteen to thirty five, They find that thirt thirty five percent thirty four percent of the consumers they find too difficult to operate a remote control.
and we can have sort of a a a trimming as well, of the glow in the dark material, just as gimmickyness., speech recognition, limited buttons, organic design. Glow in dark. if it's not too expensive s I think it's a good gimmick.
now, it was function F_ eight. f oh sorry F_ eight. and if you just click that it'll go ahead, one at a time. Oh you wanna go back? Just escape. Yeah. No signal. Computer adjusting, yeah., F_ five and escape'll bring it back and just the left button for advancing. Oh you need to twiddle the thingamibobsy thing. So I plug it in, press F_ five?
If we look at the costs whether the consumers they are willing to pay more for speech recognition in a remote control or not, we can find that they up to a thirty five years age group we have a very good disliking for this this point, like for speech recognition in a remote control. because it will definitely enhance our sales in this ag in this particular age group from fifteen to thirty five,
So we'll stick with sort of programmability for the buttons that we do have. so we'll go with speech recognition, yeah?, speech recognition, limited buttons, organic design.
we have to take care of this fact also like our design, should be appropriate, should be good looking for the consumers. and even the good thing about this is that eighty percent of users they are willing to pay high pay more for this good looking remote controls also. but rather than those having more functions in the remote controls we should emphasise what actually consumer want, what they operate, rather than making it too complicated. Because mostly it has been found that fifty percent of the users they use only ten percent of the buttons, They find that thirt thirty five percent thirty four percent of the consumers they find too difficult to operate a remote control.
we also want to limit the number of buttons, speech recognition, limited buttons, organic design.
I think we should a rechargeable battery will be a good idea. having a rechargeable stand, so that not only it doubles as a stand, but for using it as recharging it, but also for using it as sound recognition.
'cause I think we're definitely going for the speech recognition, speech recognition, I think,
but something ergonomically shaped and organic, like good to hold, based on fruits and natural things like that, because al already we're going a bit gaudy with the yellow, you know. So again I mean like we could have, I mean, we could quite easily have the the main body be a different I mean not necessarily that the the whole body has to be of the company colour, So you have the main body blue with the yellow logo and slogan running up one side of it kind of thing.
Okay, like we could have a big banana shaped remote control, and a lemon might be a little hard to grip. Yeah. How would you point it? We could have a little L_E_D_s on each end. y I'm I'm not sure about the banana idea. it does seem a bit again childish maybe. I think maybe just draw on the kind of fruit and vegetable shape. So maybe an an unidentifiable fruit or fiable fruit or vegetable Like a gourd almost, or a squash of some sort? you don't necessarily have to have it sort of clearly identified as a fruit just to have that kind of fruitish shape, Or we can do something, we can design two three shapes and we can have a public survey, let the public choose what they want. There's a good man. There's a good idea. Yeah, what about the scroll wheel and speech recognition? do we want to just have a device that maybe sits and pretends it's a fruit? l like think of a fruit that could sit sort of independently on its own like, I dunno, an apple. we can just have a remote control and casings of different different shapes, different fruit shapes in such a way that a any casing can be could be fit into this mobile general piece.
Or we can do something, we can design two three shapes and we can have a public survey, let the public choose what they want. There's a good man. There's a good idea.
So multi-coloured buttons. or yeah a limit maybe even just a limited multi-colour so it it doesn't look too childish, perhaps. Although I mean this also comes to shape as well. I mean double-curved sounds good to me if we're talking about sorta ergonomic and easy use, Like an hour glass kind of figure, I could put the microphone here. So should the microphone be just anywhere on it or button will be on the upper side, buttons will be the on the upper side.
Well, I mean like la latex has a kinda spongy feeling to it, And that would k also give it kinda durability and ther that's also f sorta relatively cheap to cast. so maybe s a sort of plastic initial plastic with a a latex kinda sheath? I like the rubber, the stress balls, I think, w like, 'cause there's gonna be the the cover the the rubber or the plastic casing and then the buttons in probably two different colours
you open it up, there's a circuit board inside, and there's a a chip, a processor, the T_A_ one one eight three five, which receives input from the buttons,
I guess there are a lot of options that we're gonna have to choose from among, and I'll I'll give you the, I guess, technical considerations for those. And I'm gonna use the whiteboard, just 'cause we haven't used it. the way I'm gonna do this is we're gonna take a look at some old remote controls, see how they work, and then we'll throw in our new innovations you open it up, there's a circuit board inside, and there's a a chip, a processor, the T_A_ one one eight three five, which receives input from the buttons, so that takes a signals from the buttons and translates it into a sequence of pulses that it then sends to the to the amplifier, which is made of some transistors and amplifiers, op-amps, and then that gets sent to the to the L_E_D_ light,. So you know, as we said, we got the outer casing, which we have to decide, you know, what's it gonna be, processor, we'll probably use the more advanced processor than they had, so for the casing, this an e-mail I got from our manufacturing team, you know, we have a bunch of options from wood, titanium, rubber, plastic, whatnot, latex, double-curved, curved.
or yeah a limit maybe even just a limited multi-colour so it it doesn't look too childish, perhaps. Although I mean this also comes to shape as well. y I'm I'm not sure about the banana idea. it does seem a bit again childish maybe. I think maybe just draw on the kind of fruit and vegetable shape. So maybe an an unidentifiable fruit or fiable fruit or vegetable Like a gourd almost, or a squash of some sort? you don't necessarily have to have it sort of clearly identified as a fruit just to have that kind of fruitish shape, do we want to just have a device that maybe sits and pretends it's a fruit? l like think of a fruit that could sit sort of independently on its own like, I dunno, an apple. Well, I I'm not sure if we should go so far in the whole fruit thing, and I think maybe fruit could be a bit of a too much of a gimmick, but something ergonomically shaped and organic, like good to hold, based on fruits and natural things like that, So you have the main body blue with the yellow logo and slogan running up one side of it kind of thing. So again I mean like we could have, I mean, we could quite easily have the the main body be a different because al already we're going a bit gaudy with the yellow, you know. I mean not necessarily that the the whole body has to be of the company colour,
so maybe s a sort of plastic initial plastic with a a latex kinda sheath? I like the rubber, the stress balls, I think, s I guess we decided on material, So that that spongy latex rubber everything feel,
and what I would like you guys to do is work on giving me a model in clay.
our next meeting's in half an hour and what I would like you guys to do is work on giving me a model in clay. and further instructions will be sent by your personal coaches.
I think we should a rechargeable battery will be a good idea. having a rechargeable stand, so that not only it doubles as a stand, but for using it as recharging it, but also for using it as sound recognition.
There's an L_C_D_ thing, I thought could get a bit confusing and a bit expensive as well for us. and I've just got an e-mail from our technical department saying that they have broken through with some new speech recognition software that you can program in. I think maybe incorporating that in our design would be good. you program it like you say, record, and then, play, and then, record, play machine, and stuff like that, the L_C_D_, it does look smart, but I think maybe for our budget, 'cause I think we're definitely going for the speech recognition, But in our market survey we have seen that people are willing to pay more, It's still it's still got to get within our twelve fifty, you know. I'm not sure if the if for twenty five Euros per twelve Euros fifty m manufacturing cost,. Although, th I mean to be to be sure they have got I mean they are going crazy with the L_C_D_ technology now, And one of the survey findings was that they want it easy to use, so I think I'm not sure about the L_C_D_. It's a it's great, it's a good idea, but for our budget and for the thing we're trying to go for eas easy to use, it's not the thing we should go for, I think. we could make a vegetabley kind of round shape, I think. Well, si since we're going for the the k the sort of company colours, I think your lemon wasn't that far s I like I like the colourful buttons as well. I like the d the different shapes of the buttons and stuff.
okay, so the interface concept. so the method, we looked at existing designs, Okay, so most remote controls use graphical interface, and we also found that there's inconsistent layout, which makes it confusing. but I think standard kind of shape and play and those kind of but buttons And we've got some pictures of some new remote controls to show you. This one is got a kind of scroll like a mouse, and But I'm not exactly sure how you'd use that, But the one below that has got like a little scroll function on the side. But I presume that the functions must come up on the T_V_ screen. Again that's just quite boring shape, grey, looks quite space-agey, but too many buttons, I think on that one. this one I thought was really cool. It's w it's got the programmability function that we talked about. and it's quite an organic shape Yeah, I m I mean the one thing I think about about these ones is these kl secured areas, I've seen a lot of them with the the cover missing. So like have it hinge rather than sort of clip on or whatever. And this one, the over-sized one, I don't know about you, but I think it's a bit too gimmicky. I like some of these things the the raised symbols and everything, the raised symbols I thought were good, And the mouse one, I thought it was a good idea, Child-friendly, I thought this was good,
When we did f fashions, recent fashion our recent fashion update shows that because d you can see how people have related their clothes, shoes, and everything with fruits and vegetables, the f feel of the material is expected to be spongy rather than just having a plastic look, hard look. Do you think like rubber would be good or does it really want to be like gel kind of stuff? The rubber which is good for health and which is quite disposable that we can take into co
in this meeting I I'm going to discuss about the trend watching, We have done a rec not only a recent remote control market survey, but we also considered the latest fre fashion trends of the market, when we did our remote control market survey we found that people l people do have preference for tho fancy mobi f remote controls which look and feel very good, rather than having a functional look and feel good. The second most important aspect is that remote control should be a technologically innovative. And the third most important aspect in the ta to take into consideration is that it should be easy to use, and customers should be provided with manuals that is easy to understand in their local language, something.
So we could even add something. yeah, we could add things. Yeah, if we're happy with the design there's no point in spending money, if we don't have to.
room for creativity, were we happy with that? W I think we were very creative. Leadership, Great leadership. teamwork. I thought went well. Yeah, everyone got enough input, I think. These pens are are neat though. Yeah, these are new ideas, like glow-in-the-dark or something like that. So just general thumbs up for all of us then.
So now is the final evaluation, final evaluation of the of our product. whether it meets our standards or not. w we together have to decide wha what rating we will give to this product and everything. We will give the rating to this product based on the user requirements, whether it meets the user requirements or not, this product. Then trends, whether it is as fashion trends or not? Then marketing strategy of the company. Now comes the criteria rating with seven point scale. what do you think whether it meets all user requirements or not? It had all the basic buttons that they needed as well as the new technology that people said they wanted. Seven is good, yeah, isn't it? True or false? one is means highest ranking, So it's one for from your point of view. I'm gonna give it a two. Oh, I'll go for a one. for me personally it is everything fine, but there is one thing which limits the customers, like we are having only two, three designs, But if a person doesn't like banana, or orange, you are limiting him. So we are showing our preference for particular fruits, Is that no is that not trends? because whatever companies they launch their products in the shape of fruits, they give a range of products, a range of shapes, But in electronics, I think, it's not q always quite so you don't always have so many choices as with chocolates. we are doing a very wrong thing. We're gonna average them? I have taken it very wrongly. About one point f one point eight. Well going on the specifications that we had, that fruit and vegetables are quite popular, and that people like something that is good to look at and not many buttons, I would give it, so I would actually give it a three. 'Kay. As far as the technology it its' got the latest trends in speech technology, but it doesn't have that fancy solar power or the the vibrating energy mechanism. it might be trendy to some, but I'm
one's based on the banana, one's based on the tomato so this is the non to non no buttons one, or as few buttons as possible, mainly speak recognition.
one's based on the banana, one's based on the tomato so this is the non to non no buttons one, or as few buttons as possible, mainly speak recognition. If you do need buttons, you can flip it over, and there's some there,
These are the s two scroll ones which we thought could be channel up and down and volume up and down.
and and we have the banana-based one too. This one is, I suppose for the younger audiences.
main problem that we have unfortunately being finance., let's just enter in the evaluation criteria. the unit we are currently going to produce minus the extra scroll buttons, it's gonna cost us fourteen point six Euros. So basically, in order to save our two Euros I was thinking that we could have essentially the same shape, but just have it flattened. Doesn't save us quite as much. W why is the double curved two of them? Oh, good point. I think it means double curved as in like a single curve on that bottom half, and the double curved would be if it was that similar curve upward. and why why I've got it two, I don't know, But you think it should be one. okay, so that would take away three, which would give us Eleven eleven Euros sixty.
So we can launch it. Yeah. 'Cause we've evaluated and we are within budget.
we forgot to mention it'll be made out of kind of a rubbery latex, new material that we've got.
it might be trendy to some, but I'm just not swallowing the fruit, But if a person doesn't like banana, or orange, you are limiting him. like we are having only two, three designs, for me personally it is everything fine, well, because it's hard to make a fruit good to look at, that that looks cool, you know,
Will you guys first with your prototype before we get to the good news? We made three for you. one's based on the banana, one's based on the tomato or as few buttons as possible, so this is the non to non no buttons one, mainly speak recognition. If you do need buttons, you can flip it over, and there's some there, Well I like the feel of it, I like the feel of it. but that's the that yellow stand there represents the the charging stand. the black on the back is the slogan. but also we're gonna have the company name on the front, which is the little black kind of line in the middle. These are the s two scroll ones which we thought could be channel up and down and volume up and down. it does actually feel quite ergonomic, It would have to be a bit bigger., obviously I don't think that's real sized. that's a speaker at the top, Oh that's the charging base prongs at the bottom. And then the big red button in the middle is the on and off one. and and we have the banana-based one too. This one is, I suppose for the younger audiences. So are there any improvements or issues or
and and we have the banana-based one too. This one is, I suppose for the younger audiences.
but that's the that yellow stand there represents the the charging stand.
the black on the back is the slogan. but also we're gonna have the company name on the front, which is the little black kind of line in the middle.
Yeah but I mean e even though it has to be re original we shouldn't go like too far away from from the usual ones, because otherwise the new users will just have a lot of problems A big learning curve, yeah.
so we need to wrap it up now,
So, this is first meeting of this design project. and I like to show you the agenda for the meeting, is firstly just to introduce the project briefly, this is the the plan for today's meeting Then the main purpose is to so that we get to know each other a little bit more. then we want to practice using some of the tools that we'll be using during the the course of the design project and the meetings, specifically the whiteboard over there. then we need to go through the specifics of our project plan come up with some preliminary ideas about it. So we've got twenty five minutes to do that,
What we're aiming to do is to create a new remote control for a television. we want it to be something original, something trendy and also something user friendly, so it has to be quite intuitive that people are able to use this product.
but im basically you're looking at the working design,
you're looking at the technical functions design,
you'll be getting specific instructions once you go back to your workspace,
so we need to wrap it up now, we've got another meeting in thirty minutes, you'll be getting specific instructions once you go back to your workspace, I'll see you in half an hour.
and for you it's the user requirements specification,
Okay, so this is the overall budget for our project. we're planning to sell the remote controls for twenty five Euros each. and with that we're aiming for a profit of fifty million Euros. And that's selling them on the international market, not just in the U_K_. so to do that our finance people estimate that we need production costs of maximum twelve and a half Euro so that we can reach that profit target. Does anyone have any first ideas to bounce around about what we're thinking of this remote control? I'm just wondering whether whether there is like any special feature that we want to have w want this remote control have as opposed to the already existing ones. but if we all have a think, when we go away from the meeting, what specific things could be included in this remote control that that are out of the ordinary. I think i in the beginning one thing was that was mentioned was that it should be trendy, user friendly and original that we should provide some features that are quite unique to this. although I don't think that it's a huge problem for remote controls anyway, battery life, but we can aim for something wi that gives a high battery life, I mean we can think about all these little things,
And that's selling them on the international market, not just in the U_K_.
So I'm kind of thinking, you know like those phones that they have, the new generation ones, where they don't actually have any buttons on them and stuff like that. So perhaps some sort of menu-based thing, or like I mean you know, theoretically you can do all kinds of things with your T_V_, right? Something that's a little less crowded than this, But what do most people do? They turn it on, they watch certain specified channels, you know, and then they turn it off again. There is a lot of functionality in there that is not used ninety percent of the time, It could be one button for a menu or something, if you really need to go and do that. and you can do it on the screen rather than everybody else having to have those buttons, which just confuse them. because otherwise the new users will just have a lot of problems Yeah but I mean e even though it has to be re original we shouldn't go like too far away from from the usual ones, A big learning curve, yeah.
So I'm kind of thinking, you know like those phones that they have, the new generation ones, where they don't actually have any buttons on them and stuff like that. So perhaps some sort of menu-based thing, or Something that's a little less crowded than this, It could be one button for a menu or something, if you really need to go and do that.
The method that we're going to use to complete the project, that has three components as such. There's the functional design of the the remote control. the way we'll do that I think is to to work individually initially and then come together for meetings to to work on that. similarly with the conceptual design, and then the detailed design will come after that. We'll pull it all together. I'm a bit confused about what's the difference between the functional design and conceptual design? i is it just more detail, as I understand it? I think it th w we're talking the the functional design is more your area of things where you'll be we want to look at what functions we need in the remote control but the conceptual design is perhaps bigger than that and includes the how people are going to use it and and that kind of thing. it's in the conceptual design phase that we identify the components of our product? I think we'll we'll start that initially with the functional design already but then
we're planning to sell the remote controls for twenty five Euros each.
what I'd like us to do now is simultaneously introduce ourselves and start using some of the tools that we're using for for the project, each person in turn, I'd like us to go up to the whiteboard, and draw your favourite animal and then tell everyone what the f your favourite characteristics of that animal are and while you're doing that tell us your name, what your role is and perhaps how your animal relates to the role that you're taking in this project. So, my name's Cat this is a rabbit. I am the Marketing Expert I'm gonna be doing the apparently according to the little guy in the computer that knows everything the user g requirements specification of the functional design, trend watching in the conceptual design and product evad-valuation in the detailed design so my name is Maarika. I'm the Interface Designer in this project but I do like dogs. so in the different stages of the design, so at first I will be responsible for for yeah, designing the technical functions of the of the remote control then in the in the conceptual design stage I need to come up with interface concept my name is Gaurav. my my role in the project is the industrial designer, so I'm supposed to design all the details of of the product what are the various functions that have to be performed by it during the conceptual design, I'm Jen. It's a gecko. and I'm your Project Manager for today and my role is basically to keep things going and make sure that you all work together in a productive way, so that by the end of the day we come up with a great product.
and with that we're aiming for a profit of fifty million Euros.
You'll be looking you'll be looking at the user interface concept,
What we have to do now is to go back to our little places, complete our questionnaire and some sort of summarisation, Send me your presentations so that I can use them to make the minutes, w before lunch we just have to complete the questionnaire and some sort of summary.
but that then does imply that we should try and incorporate voice recognition. Is that gonna have a an implication for the technical specs? but voice recognition itself I'm not very sure about, With but with a T_V_ remote it's gonna be quite limited if we're t saying the main things people want to do is on off channel five, tha that should be relatively simple. y you'd maybe need a code word. but like so you'd just say remote five, you know, remote ten, remote one two nine. but maybe if you wanna look into that just to just to check. w well now the v the voice recognition if if it works wonderfully w we could possibly do away with all buttons, but I think this is not really the right moment yet, because people are just so used to buttons What wh what I was thinking is that there is this separation between what the channels are on T_V_ and how they are numbered on the remote control. If we can do with away with that, our product can be really popular in the sense that a person can say, I want to watch I_T_V_ one instead of saying that I want to go onto channel number forty five. So that if that was in the the voice recognition, that would be great. It's more like if you lost it and it's down the sofa sometime, you can yell at it and it'll just change it, you can look for it later, yeah. Yeah but m but on the other hand, remote control isn't as close to you you probably might just just speak into it yeah and it might become very difficult from a distance for the television to understand what you're saying because of the noise factor for the remote control No, but I I I was just defending the the fact why why we want to keep the remote control close to us, a and not to yell at it from the distance. So wh another thing that can be used is that there can
but you know I d I do wonder how well that would work given that a T_V_, you know, tends to be people talking so clearly voice recognition is something to think about, and, you know, how are you going to stop it from just flipping channels whilst watching T_V_. but that then does imply that we should try and incorporate voice recognition. Is that gonna have a an implication for the technical specs? but voice recognition itself I'm not very sure about, With but with a T_V_ remote it's gonna be quite limited if we're t saying the main things people want to do is on off channel five, tha that should be relatively simple. y you'd maybe need a code word. but like so you'd just say remote five, you know, remote ten, remote one two nine. but maybe if you wanna look into that just to just to check. w well now the v the voice recognition if if it works wonderfully w we could possibly do away with all buttons, but I think this is not really the right moment yet, because people are just so used to buttons So that if that was in the the voice recognition, that would be great. It's more like if you lost it and it's down the sofa sometime, you can yell at it and it'll just change it, you can look for it later, yeah. Yeah but m but on the other hand, remote control isn't as close to you you probably might just just speak into it yeah and it might become very difficult from a distance for the television to understand what you're saying because of the noise factor for the remote control No, but I I I was just defending the the fact why why we want to keep the remote control close to us, a and not to yell at it from the distance. But if we go away with that that kind of general specification in mind that we're looking at fifteen to thirty five year olds, we want it to look simple, but
as to where we're going from here, you're going to look at the components concept.
and you're watching trends to see how we go
And w some of the main functions would be switching on, switching off, then the user would like to switch the channel for example just m changing to the next channel to to flip through all all of the possible channels, or then the other possibility would be that she might just want to choose one particular channel, so we would need the numbers. And and also the volume is very important. But then other functionalities could be just there could be a menu button and you could change things on the screen then, for example brightness and similar functions could be just done through the menu.
So my personal preferences would be to keep the the whole remote control small just like the physical size. And then it must be easy to use, so it must follow some conventions like whereabouts you find the on off button and maybe the colour tends to be red or something.
So n with with regard to the working design of this remote control I've identified a few basic components of the remote and se from the design, functional design perspective w I c we can now know wha what exactly the components are the identification of the components, and since since I'm dealing only with the technical aspects, I would need feedback from the marketing person and from the user interface person. we'll then integrate this into the product design at a technical level these were the basic findings from today. The last three bullets have been integrated from the last minute email. as I told you the identification of how the remote control works and what are the various parts to it and what are the different processes and how the parts communicate with each other. also the remote control should be used only for television, because incorporating other features makes it more comp complex. And the reason why teletext is outdated because of internet and the availability of internet over television. also the management wants that our design should be unique so it should incorporate colour and the slogan that our company has it as its standard. Okay, so he he here is a functional overview of the remote control. there's basically an energy source at the heart which feeds into the chip and the user interface. The user interf interface communicates with the chip, if if this is our energy source and this is a cell, it communicates it feeds energy into the into the chip, which basically finds out h how how to do everything. There is a user interface here. So whe when the user presses a button, it feeds into the chip and the chip then generates a response and takes the response to an infrared terminal, the there can be a bulb here or something to indicate whether the remote is on or communicating. so the output of the chip is an infrared bit code, whatever new functions that we need to do, make the chip more complicated and bigger, basically. i in my
I think since since we were discussing some design issues then I I I would like to continue So I'm going to speak about technical functions design my method was to look at other remote controls, so mostly just by searching on the web And then after having got this inspiration and having compared what I found on the web just to think about what the de what the user really needs and what what the user might desire as additional functionalities. so the findings were that the main function of the remote control is is just sending messages to the television set, And w some of the main functions would be switching on, switching off, then the user would like to switch the channel for example just m changing to the next channel to to flip through all all of the possible channels, or then the other possibility would be that she might just want to choose one particular channel, so we would need the numbers. And and also the volume is very important. among the findings I found that m m most of the curr presently available remote controls also include other functionalities in their design, like operating a V_C_R_, but they don't seem to be able to deal with D_V_D_ players, but according to the last minute update actually we do not want to have all this complicated functions added to our design. So my personal preferences would be to keep the the whole remote control small just like the physical size. And then it must be easy to use, so it must follow some conventions like whereabouts you find the on off button and maybe the colour tends to be red or something. But then other functionalities could be just there could be a menu button and you could change things on the screen then, for example brightness and similar functions could be just done through the menu. the last question I had about whether we wanted to incorporate n more functionalities, the answer was already no because of the last minute update. but if we had
so these are my personal preferences. So you have sleek, stylish, sophisticated, you know, so something that's, you know, a bit cool. you know, functional, so it's useful, but minimalist. so things should either be functional or beautiful or preferably both, okay, then a long battery life, like you were talking about earlier and, you know, I was thinking that solar power would be quite cool because, you know, your remote control just sits there, and you could just sit it in the sunshine and save the environment a bit. so you know, kind of like you have for a mobile phone or Some kind of a ring, Whistle and it screams at you, yeah. So yeah, so maybe something where you clap and then it beeps, and then like a locator,
So, we've got about ten, fifteen minutes to discuss I think one of the very interesting things that came up in Ka Kate Cat Cat's presentation was this this issue of like voice recognition being more popular with younger people. So if we need to have a target group then I think as far as the m motto of our company is concerned, if we want to have something sleek and you know, good looking we are better off targeting a younger audience then you know, people who are comparatively elderly. I mean that's the thing is that it didn't say in the survey, you know, whether, you know, these are the people that will pay more for a more stylish remote control, Bu but but the survey did say that f things like voice recognition are more popular with them, Then again I guess the th where it was most popular was the fifteen to twenty five bracket and the I don't know how often they're buying televisions. I would've thought it's it's more that twenty five to thirty five, when people are really moving out and they've got their first job and they want their nice toys and wh people between twenty five to thirty five, how popular was Seventy six point three percent. but I mean it has been proven that that people of that age group have a higher disposable income I mean like it is an age group to target, really, I think. and if we're if we're talking twenty five Euros as a price, that's not unaffordable, even for young people. but the problem is whether people need it, whether they do have a T_V_ to use its full and be a bit strange to have a fancy rome remote. I think I think the fact that, you know, ninety one point two percent of fifteen to twenty five year olds are saying yes, I would pay more for a voice recognition remote control, does say quite a lot really. but at the same time I think maybe we can we can just decide to
and have some kind of a fancy user interface or something like that. well, I think the buttons are still kind of the most easy for the user to use, or I mean in we can completely do away with buttons so so at this stage, how we go about implementing those button we will not identify So in the u user interface requirements we we have been able to identify what are the basic buttons that we do want. I mean what other options would you have? A little screen or something, but this would be really kind of I think a lot of learning for the user and and I mean the user just wants to get get a result quickly, not to spend time in like giving several orders I dunno. I think I th I would I would think the put the buttons, I think the co costs will also play a big role when we come to know about them. So well we can probably wait until t we have more knowledge on that. i if the if the costs allow, we can have like an L_C_D_ display because we do want something fancy and fashionable as well.
So what I have, wh where I've got my information from is a survey where the usability lab observed remote control use with a hundred subjects and then they gave them a questionnaire. What they found is that people don't like how current remote controls are, seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly. eighty percent of users would spend more to get you know, a nice looking remote control. current remote controls, they don't match the user behaviour well, I dunno what zapping is, It's switching between channels, sort of randomly going through. But you have that little thing that comes up at the bottom and tells you what's on. okay, fifty percent of users say they only use ten percent of the buttons, so that's going back to what, you know, we were saying earlier about, you know, do you need all the buttons on the remote control, they just make it look ugly. so this is my little graph thing. what it shows is how much things are used relatively and what you can clearly see from that is the thing that's used most is the channel selection. What you can't see is volume selection, it's a little bit higher than all the others. so what the graph shows is that, you know, power, channel selection and volume selection are important, and the rest of them, you know, nobody really uses and so that's the the numbers along the top represent their like their importance, you know, and, you know, channel selection and volume selection are absolutely essential, and the power, well it's not quite so essential, apparently, and everything else, I think, you know, you can forget about having those buttons on the remote control, so this is what people find annoying about remote controls. that they get lost, that the you know, they're not intuitive and that they're bad for repetitive strain injury. you want something with an ergonomic t design that encourages good use of the remote control but that shows how people whether they would pay more for voice recognition software. So
now we are here at the functional design meeting. hopefully this meeting I'll be doing a little bit less talking than I did last time 'cause this is when you get to show us what you've been doing individually. The agenda for the meeting, I put it in the sh shared documents folder. I'll act as secretary for this meeting and just take minutes as we go through, The main the main focus of this meeting is your presentations that you've been preparing during the time, then we need to briefly discuss the new project requirements that were sent to us. at the last minute, then we need to, by the end of the meeting come to some kind of decision on who our target group's going to be and what the functions of the remote control You said targ target groups, what does that mean? As who it is that we're going to be trying to sell this thing to, yeah, we need to have a fairly defined group that that we want to focus on Just before you start, to make it easier, would you three mind emailing me your presentations? Once we you don't have to do it now but when once you go back, just so that I don't have to scribble everything down.
Looking at what we've got, we we want an L_C_D_ display with a spinning wheel. You have to have some push-buttons, don't you? Just spinning and not scrolling, I would say. I think the spinning wheel is definitely very now. but since L_C_D_s seems to be a definite yes, We're having push-buttons on the outside and then on the inside an L_C_D_ with spinning wheel,
It has to be at least curved from one side, yeah. But if you've got a if if you've got a flipped thing, effectively it's something that's curved on one side and flat on the other side, but you folded it in half. Flat on the top. and a curved on one side case which is folded in on itself, made out of rubber
So now we seem to have a consensus that L_C_D_s are definitely the way to go Yeah, I think so. because of style and
Okay, apparently, fruit and vegetables will be providing inspiration. so these will be an important feature for clothes, shoes and furniture. So I mean, I'm taking this to mean, you know, curviness. 'Cause you don't tend to get flat vegetables. You know? and possibly even uneven, bit of asymmetry and stuff. But that would be a good way to to get in the whole R_S_I_ issue in there, so you wanna you curve it so that it's suitable for use with the right hand.
Okay, straight to trends, so what I did was to search the internet to come up with market trends and you know what users are gonna be wanting in the the near future. Now, the first aspect is apparently twice as important as the second aspect, which is twice as important as the third a aspect. So, I mean the the easy to use thing is fairly low down on the which I think given the target group is what you would expect, really., you know, people want something new, something technologically innovative and different, so the whole idea with the L_C_D_s and the spinning and the colours and the voice recognition is quite like, quite the thing to go for. So maybe as you're discussing things, is it okay if we just keep highlighting things here? so probably voice recognition is is kind of important, right? And maybe the L_C_D_ and spinning Okay, I I have a point about L_C_D_, W L_C_D_s are basically for feedback, right, to the user who's pressing buttons, and the feedback can come through television itself, so do we need an L_C_D_ on the remote? Depends how fast your television runs, really, I mean we've got one of those Telewest boxes and you put the number in the remote so i it actually takes quite a long time. so I think, you know, a screen on the remote would probably cut down your time on that. It it is also quite nice though to to have something here so you don't interrupt the picture on the screen, But I think maybe a way to do it would be a similar way to how you have your mobile phone, you know, like you have the slidey ones and you have the flippy ones So you can have like what looks like a normal remote control, you know or like a minimalist remote control. So you got your buttons one to nine, your on and off and your volume on that and then if you want to mess about with it, you flip it open and,
So in in the case of many user interfaces, they're just so full of buttons that it's actually hard to find the ones you you really want to use and and it's just confusing, it takes y know time to learn. and I thought I would just quickly show some of them that I found. so yeah, they're quite big and have many many buttons. Actually of the of all these I personally p prefer this one, because it's it's the smallest and and with with least with the smallest number of buttons as well. And I would say even the appearance of some of them is kind of not so nice. Our own company has developed a new in user interface we can include voice recognition i it's possible to record eighty different voice samples on it. s another new development is a scroll button, so this this one was already mentioned the L_C_ display. And our own manufacturing division ha has designed a new programmable speech it it it comes together with a voice recognition, So I mean this is also one of the n dev new developments which we might consider if we wanted to include. but it's once once the gadget recognises the voice of the speaker, there can be a pre-programmed answer, are you sure wha what this means, a spinning wheel with the L_C_ display? the scroll button is a different thing. I I have a picture if you just a moment, Oh okay, the iPod thing, yeah. but I think it's just like it's it's a wheel, it's like not separate buttons. It's like it's like where you you know how you have your your mouse, and y you go round and i it's kind of like that and you spin round I like the the wheels that click on the side you you get 'em much slower, Do you know, if you're lookin if you're th scrolling through the A_ to Z_ of your music and you're looking for something at T_, then it's a lot faster than the wheel, but you've got
and then make the colour of the main remote the colour like vegetable colours, do you know? I mean I suppose vegetable colours would be orange and green and some reds and maybe purple and it's gonna look sort of vegetable, and be in bright vegetable colours.
Right, interface concept. to be honest actually, I mentioned some some of the things which which could fit on the on the this talk this time, I m I mentioned them already in the previous talk. So yeah, this time I might not have them on the slides but I I can just mention them aw again. So I thought I would also include the definition of user interface so it's the aspects of a of of a computer system or programme which can be seen by the user the mechanisms that the user uses to control its operation and input data. So this would p includes things like shape and size and buttons and voice recognition as well, and colour, and so on. the method I employed this time was a again having a look to related products and mainly on the internet and then analyse them from the point of view of user fen friendliness and also whether their appearance was was pleasant. this can help us to decide which features we want to incorporate in our product. So in in the case of many user interfaces, they're just so full of buttons that it's actually hard to find the ones you you really want to use and and it's just confusing, it takes y know time to learn. and I thought I would just quickly show some of them that I found. so yeah, they're quite big and have many many buttons. Actually of the of all these I personally p prefer this one, because it's it's the smallest and and with with least with the smallest number of buttons as well. And I would say even the appearance of some of them is kind of not so nice.
so th this concerns firs first of all the the chips I I showed you at The P_C_B_ is inexpensive, so we can put put in whatever we want, but the various integrated circuit options are, we have either a simple one or a regular or advanced. okay, so the good thing about wh wh why why we would want to use advanced u why we might want to use advanced is that L_C_D_s can only come with the advanced chip. we need regular or advanced for scroll wheels. and the chip basically includes the infra infrared sender. besides this in electr under electronics also the company has started making a sample sender, which is did not explained what i what it was, So I'm guessing that the sample speaker is probably something like you know, as soon as you press a button, it it give gives you feedback, one five or whatever. I dunno whether sample sender sender has to do something with voice recognition or not, but anyway.
So the batteries, I'll start with the battery, right? So they can be simple which is like the normal batteries in our the cells, yeah? And dynamos. So I don't know if even if you want to consider this, So the third one is the kinetic energy ones. The the kinetic energy one is that e they are usually modern watches, since our hand keeps moving, it keeps the watch ticking. But I dunno i if it is a good idea for a remote control, because it'll just lie there for a long while sometimes. But as soon as you pick it up it moves and then again it re recharges or something. And the fourth option is the solar cells, which are also made by the company. Environment friendly. There are different cases that can be provided. They can be basically the shape of the cases, they can be flat, they can be curved with one-sided curved and one side flat, and they can be curved with on both the sides. you mean this would be like the the overall shape of the remote control, yeah, Yeah, there were different kind of supplements available, like it can be in plastic, rubber, wood, or titanium, right? so we can use even a certain titanium is also used in the company to make some space design equipment, so it's kind of it'll be probably nicer to use, because it relates to the overall image of the company, but it cannot be used on a double curved surface. the interface options now. we can have push-buttons, like most remotes do we can have scroll wheels like the ones on mouse pointers they can even have an an integrated push-button inside the scrolling thing. we can have L_C_D_s.
so I haven't made a PowerPoint presentation, I I thought I'll use the whiteboard instead. I thought I'll use the whiteboard because we have so many different options and what we can do is that we can start rubbing off the options that we do not require and putting in the options that are m or highlighting or underlining them or something like that. Okay, so I'll start again with a brief introduction to connect that anyway brief introduction to the insides of a remote control If you open it, you have a circuit board here, right, and this is the chip that I was talking about last time. This basically sends information to a tr transistor here, which then sends the information to an L_E_D_ device here. If you flip the printed circuit board, and this is th the most important point here, So you see for example a particular button attaches to a particular place on the P_C_B_ on pressing this button I a circuit completes, the information goes to the chip, which is somewhere here and the chip that tra then translates the code into an infra infrared radiation, which goes goes out through there. So the important point that I read over the website was that the configurations of these printed circuit circuit boards are quite cheap to make, so these are the different options that we have.
I sent you the agenda, it was on the in the project documents. Anyway, it's the meeting's gonna follow more or less the same structure as last time, so we'll go round each of you in turn and you can give your presentations on what you've been up to. and at the end of that we need to discuss what you've come up with, so that we can make a decision on the key remote control concepts, we need to know about the components' properties, materials, the user interface and any trends that the Marketing Expert has been watching.
And as well as that, the two designers are going to work together on our prototype following those instructions that we've just come up with using modelling clay
and the Marketing Expert is going to work on product evaluation.
the case would be rubber and the the buttons, and the buttons are also rubber.
and you will get extra instructions from your personal coach.
Looking at what we've got, we we want an L_C_D_ display with a spinning wheel. hand dynamos are definitely out, right? it's not that's not streamlined and sexy, having a having a wind up. kinetic energy does seem to have some kind of appeal, It's about the practicality of it really, isn't it? You know? this this thing will have to be tapped every time, which which might be very frustrating for the user. Depends how much how much movement it really needs. Okay, let's keep it option keep an option, Wood, do you think wood will be a good idea? I can't imagine a m wooden remote control. and given that we're we're looking at more spongy material preferences, I ha would think maybe rubber or plastic is more I mean it's it's alright for a table, And splinters and stuff and You have to have some push-buttons, don't you? I think for for the channel numb channel numbers you still need them, wouldn't you? if you have an L_C_D_ display, then you can select almost everything on the L_C_D_ display. when we s discussed that we might like this flipping open thing, then I mean y you can use it as a normal remote control, I think this is going back to the the graph at the beginning that I made, where, you know, the buttons that people use all the time, you want buttons for them and everything else menu-driven. I think the thing is, so if someone just wants to turn on their T_V_ and put on a channel, then it should be easier to use than any other remote, and then if someone wants to, you know, change the contrast on their T_V_ and they should be able to do that and it should be accessible, So I think it it doesn't make sense to have both like a scrolling and spinning thing, Just spinning and not scrolling, I would say. But I mean the the thing with this whole if y you're planning on making it out of rubber, on the basis that it's spongy
I think for for the channel numb channel numbers you still need them, wouldn't you? I think this is going back to the the graph at the beginning that I made, where, you know, the buttons that people use all the time, you want buttons for them and everything else menu-driven.
, I'm not quite sure about the relevance of material will be spongy. Something a bit squishy and So it could be like a rubbery and it'd help if you drop it, So if if we use latex cases, they won't allow us to use solar cells, as an energy source Or if we want to use the the latex, then we have to go with one of the other power things. so we could use titanium, wood or plastic or If it's made of rubber you could get the kinetic energy fairly easily there, So probably double curved surface is the way to go, Or or curved at one end and flat on the top, You have to have a certain element of flatness, I think. singe single side curved or double side curved does not say too much, does it? so I mean does curved one side mean one side is straight Di now did it say anywhere in your research material about this sliding stuff and, you know curved two sides means the whole thing is just a big curvy p thing? because according to the information that I have, I think the onl only options that we have with the case is are these three. It does not say anything about whether technically, you know, this this stuff is available at all. it's it's more about the protecting the L_C_D_, which I think is where it came from. But no, my research didn't tell me anything,
I think if we can if we can include them at not too much extra cost, then I'd put them in, we we're definitely going in for voice recognition as well as L_C_D_s,. So we've basically worked out that we're going with a simple battery,
the User Interface Designer will work on the user interface design
In the meantime, the Industrial Designer over here is gonna work on the look and feel design,
but we could just have some some very very easy device that just beeps. We're gonna have a beep.
costs are within budget, One Euro left over for bits that we didn't foresee. we've evaluated the project. Can you put that in the project documents file? And the process wheel didn't really have any major problems with. we've got like five minutes left. but if we've finished, then we've finished. Yeah, it was a pleasure working with you. So I would say that's the end of that meeting. Right, so we have to complete the final questionnaire and meeting summary when they send it. Was there a questionnaire already sent? Do we have to go back into the other room or can we stay in here now? I don't see why you can't stay here, really.
And it's the whole thing's made of rubber, is that
So what we're gonna do is prefer prepare the evaluation of the new design. so we're gonna be using a seven point scale, so one is, you know, yes, it totally meets with that requirement and seven is, no, it really doesn't, we need to go back and start again., you know. Basically, what I did was I went through all the like user requirements and things that we've done and we've worked on and like made a list of them. So for each of these we need to give it a one to seven. I did have A_, B_, C_, and D_ down here, but it seems to have turned into like just bullet points. Okay. But if you can imagine that they say A_, B_, C_, and D_, then that would be really good. Okay what I've done on the next page is I've set it up so we just put the marks in. If you take a note of them, left-handed people can't normally write right-handed, the the only thing that we were considering was that this thing is kind of more for right-handed people than for left-handed people, Does it match the operating behaviour of the user? so y so we we might do we might want to do like a another m model another another version, which is like exactly the mirror image of this one. So maybe we need to put that needs a little bit of investigation, maybe give it a five, I would say? Or maybe six, It might be a little clumsy when when it opens up, right, I th I think the alternative is flipping from the top. Yeah, but we which makes it kind of really big, yeah. or are we saying we're gonna stick a locator on the T_V_? th there's the locator dot. that you stick on T_V_. so that means you need a that does mean you need a little speaker on it though, To make it beep. so that's seven, yeah. If if this means intuitive, if it means the way people kind of are used
One simple battery. The chip, we're going for an advanced chip on print.
maybe give it a five, I would say? Or maybe six, It might be a little clumsy when when it opens up, right, I th I think the alternative is flipping from the top. Yeah, but we which makes it kind of really big, yeah. so that's seven, yeah. If if this means intuitive, if it means the way people kind of are used to finding things I'd say six, 'cause the I mean the the standard layout for numbers is three three three and one, rather than the way you've got it. but it's not the immediate thing that you're used to. but it's a good technology, I mean once they get used to it. So, should we maybe say f a five So, should we give it a six? the ergonom ergonomic design well I mean I d I dunno, I mean the the repetitive stress things, but then who would be really pushing the buttons so much on the on the remote control anyway, And moreover it it has L_C_D_ and everything, so that you know we minimise the pressing of the buttons anyway. Okay, so we give that a six, What do you reckon, five, six? Six. So, we need the average here, So I think we've done very well, The average is about six and something. Six point five, yeah. that's pretty good, I think.
Yeah, I think we could do l the logo in grey, as it is on the website.
so we've looked at the prototype presentation and the evaluation criteria. And now we have to calculate the production costs. So I've got an Excel spreadsheet to help us do that. I started filling it in, No hand dynamo, right? One simple battery. The chip, we're going for an advanced chip on print. We also said the sample sensor and sample speaker. single-curved surface, so that we can fold it. Case material we said rubber. I don't know what special colour means. I think something coloured, but rubber comes coloured, doesn't it? You know. maybe it's like if you want titanium coloured or wood coloured, it's different. Or maybe maybe if you want some kind of pattern thing on it, We have pushbuttons, Scroll wheel with pushbutton we had, no? And we have L_C_ display And button supplements. Yeah, but what do we ha we have L_C_ display, but but the wh but the s spinning wheel We've got more than one pushbutton though, That means you can only have twenty five push buttons in total doesn't it? That seems unlikely. whether whether pushbutton means that p count by button or do we We have to count all of them, I don't think that makes sense. if it is pushbutton then you got a zero point five, it's a scroll wheel so we we've put it's pushbutton and scroll wheel and L_C_D_ display, So, as we can see, that's way too expensive down here. Our budget's twelve point five.
So we have that n channels here starting from one two three And then, well this is on off button. The volume is is scrolling.
Yeah, the sample sensor will have to go, 'cause that's the most expensive thing on there. so that has implications though for the. it does not have for voice recognition, but it does have for the feedback speaker. when you say when you press one it says one or it says hello. But that's a bit of a gimmick anyway really, isn't it? and the locator also goes away. Well the speaker the sample speaker is is expensive, but we could just have some some very very easy device that just beeps. A also i in the case I'm not sure that you will evaluate this as a curved surface, because it's just rubber, so it's probably a flat surface rubber. Right, so we need one fifty off. Take it down to just a scroll wheel. in the L_C_D_ we can scroll, right? how do we how do we make a selection in in the L_C_D_? But how do we make a selection if we d cannot push the button. you can push this one, but we don't have a pushbutton we ca we don't have this muting mechanism for this scrolling thing. So that's point three. and I thought we were referring to this as a scroll spinning wheel and pushbutton thing. The scroll wheel is on the side. We're point three over at the moment. Unless we just take off the scroll wheel altogether and just have pushbuttons for the volume. Instead of scrolling here we have two buttons here, up for up and down. Oh look, we're way under budget Yeah, well we could admit to the single curve, couldn't we? Or or that we have to have some sort of special colour. So did we lose on our evaluation criteria, as a result of doing that? No, I don't think so. Because we keep all the features, we keep voice recognition, we keep L_C_D_ display. instead of having scrolling we we just push the buttons. But we lose the locator. so we still have the locate. We're gonna have a beep. It can come in the same
I think n one thing that was lacking was that we did not know what the various things cost to begin with. If we'd had that sheet at the beginning should've been like, okay, so we can have that lot, let's just throw it together and do what we can.
So, as we can see, that's way too expensive down here. Yeah, the sample sensor will have to go, 'cause that's the most expensive thing on there. Take it down to just a scroll wheel. Right, so we need one fifty off. We're point three over at the moment. Unless we just take off the scroll wheel altogether Instead of scrolling here we have two buttons here, up for up and down. The only the only problem being that at the end we had to cut some things down because of the the budget we had.
and the the L_C_D_ and and the scroll are inside.
This is our final meeting, the detailed design meeting. what we have to get through in this meeting is firstly the prototype presentation from you two, so you can show us what you've been working on so diligently. It does look very cool. then Cat's going to present the evaluation criteria that we're going to be evaluating this against. Then I need to say some st a few things about finance, 'cause we have to check that it's within the finance criteria. and then we'll be making sure that our product fits both the evaluation criteria from Cat and the financial limits. and then we will have a brief evaluation of the whole process of production and design that we've been through.
but it's not the immediate thing that you're used to.
so will you maybe start with like the the shape and things and and then I will explain the the user interface th things, like the buttons and the scrolling things and Okay. So basically going with our trend of vegetables and we selected the colour and approximate shape of banana. You think bananas are a safe thing to use? It's a bit phallic. Well, but it's it's just an a approximation. so I would say that this curvy does look quite like a vegetable. yeah, but one thing we actually kind of forgot while designing, that one side was supposed to be rounder, Is it to scale, or do you think you can make it a bit smaller? it could be made a bit smaller, And it's with the the black and yellow you're even in the right colours. Yeah, I think we could do l the logo in grey, as it is on the website.
'cause the I mean the the standard layout for numbers is three three three and one, rather than the way you've got it. If if this means intuitive, if it means the way people kind of are used to finding things but it's a good technology, I mean once they get used to it. but it's not the immediate thing that you're used to.
Okay. So basically going with our trend of vegetables and we selected the colour and approximate shape of banana. And it flips open on the side, so it opens like that.
so basically it's the it's the flip open thing again. And it flips open on the side, so it opens like that. And we have the user interface o in here and the the L_C_D_ and and the scroll are inside. And it's the whole thing's made of rubber, is that So so the user interface as as we discussed last time on on the on the cover we just have the very basic things. So we have that n channels here starting from one two three So it's four, up to four, up to seven, up to nine and zero, z zero here. And then, well this is on off button. and and also the colour is quite often red, And then these ones would be for flipping the channels back and And and we would also have a l little thing saying here, previous and ne prevon prevon next. The volume is is scrolling. On the side, And and and it's it's on the back is cover or back lid, because if you flip it open, you can still do the scrolling here. and and you have the spinning wheel with options to choose. Oh, the thing we forgot was like a mute button. Well, we'll have this on the screen, on the display. On the wheel, like if you hold the wheel down then it will mute. on the L_C_D_ we r you know, the main menu will have various options. yeah, the scrolling is kind of you have to scroll all the way to make it mute, right? if it's a scroll and click so you hold it in? But if you hold it in, And okay, so i so the the voice recognition is also just part of it. You can't really see it in the interface.
left-handed people can't normally write right-handed, the the only thing that we were considering was that this thing is kind of more for right-handed people than for left-handed people, so y so we we might do we might want to do like a another m model another another version, which is like exactly the mirror image of this one. It might be a little clumsy when when it opens up, right,
Right, so we have to complete the final questionnaire and meeting summary when they send it. Was there a questionnaire already sent?
so it would be good if we could just have a little talk about the project itself and how it went, so that we can feed back to the management for next time they're designing a product. as far as creativity is concerned, yeah I think there was there was room for creativity. The only the only problem being that at the end we had to cut some things down because of the the budget we had. I think n one thing that was lacking was that we did not know what the various things cost to begin with. If we'd had that sheet at the beginning should've been like, okay, so we can have that lot, let's just throw it together and do what we can. But in terms of the process of going and working individually and then coming back to a meeting, that that worked in terms of. I think 'cause the meetings were so regular, you know. Yeah, the m the means were very very good, the means we used. the whiteboard digital pens. We like the pens. But that worked well having having a whiteboard that we could draw on as well as having the PowerPoint, New ideas found. Not quite sure what about. Well it's it's it's pretty new, I think we'd like to think the ideas were new,
I was I was satisfied with with the leadership, yeah. Yeah, and and and this time also the time limits but actually preparing the I mean especially with that last-minute alteration. I mean that was fairly tight anyway, But yeah, but I mean already just just preparing the slides before before the meeting, yeah. You weren't like a a dictating leader, so that was always good. And then the teamwork I think I think it worked quite quite nicely, yeah. Did anyone feel that they were getting sort of covered up and not being able to say their bit?. I guess it was a fairly small group, so all of us got to express our opinions, yeah. And my main difficulty was the the time pressure. sometimes it's like a little bit rushed.
single-curved surface, so that we can fold it.
User Interface Designer, that's that's so you gotta you go, you're you're gonna be the one that's working out what what buttons we need.. Industrial Designer, you are the one, you know, you're gonna be working out kind of box it goes in, I guess so,. Har how it works an And in marketing User requirements specifications. Do you think our two kind of overlap, because Yeah, it does seem like our our responsibilities have some overlap. You two you two are gonna be just, I think, you just double up, you know, you working together. You're the one that's gotta go and find out do th do the research,
profit aim fifty million Euros.
have one very complicated one on one side with all the D_V_D_ and V_C_R_ access and stuff, and then on the other side o one a remote control that would be very very simple with just the channel, program plus and minus, and the just the mute button, for example. I'm not sure if it's a good idea to have a two sided remote though, 'cause it would be very hard to use in the way that you mani manipulate it. No, but you would slide it into someth like something on the back would hold or something like a flip telephone, something like that maybe.
selling price twenty five Euros,
So would be nice to have something that that controls lots of different things. but that would p that would probably be quite expensive. I think we should also have a back-up plan of I but also devices connected to the to the T_V_, I mean, be able to operate D_V_D_ players, things like that. 'cause I I I just think that it might be expensive to make something that We should have a back-up plan of just a really good television remote control, that just that is just for a T_V_, but it's just a really good, nice one.
Okay, project finance, selling price twenty five Euros, profit aim fifty million Euros. Market range internationally sold. it's gotta be can't cost any more than twelve fifty to make. Right, who's got experiences with remote controls then? Is this a T_V_ one we are supposed to make? Yeah. Yeah it's a T_V_ remote control. Are we are we going for like like telephones are going little teeny tiny things or we are going for something that's that's big and I mean, you want you want one remote that maybe can work all all of the functions of T_V_ and if you have whatever associated with T_V_ the D_V_D_ player, or something like that, but like at the same time you don't wanna really busy remote with a thousand buttons on it or something. 'Cause I I I mean I was thinking something that's got different like maybe a a an L_C_D_ display on it that's got different pages for different devices, but that would p that would probably be quite expensive. and then after we after we've found out what we can like, some different ideas, we can then go and do the research to find out if these any of these ideas are feasible or not. So would be nice to have something that that controls lots of different things. Couldn't we have like one that comes out? you actually just putting three or four different remotes together but making them thinner, and into one basically. have one very complicated one on one side with all the D_V_D_ and V_C_R_ access and stuff, and then on the other side o one a remote control that would be very very simple with just the channel, program plus and minus, and the just the mute button, for example. I'm not sure if it's a good idea to have a two sided remote though, 'cause it would be very hard to use in the way that you mani manipulate it. No, but you would slide it into someth like something on the back would hold or something like a flip telephone, something like
So is the agenda? Opening, acquaintance, tool training and project plan, discussion and then closing. Project aim is a new remote control. It's original, trendy and it's user-friendly. Try out the whiteboard, every participant should draw their favourite animal and sum up their favourite characteristics of that animal. so, I guess that was the test to see if this equipment is all working.
it's gotta be can't cost any more than twelve fifty to make.
I think we should also have a back-up plan of I 'cause I I I just think that it might be expensive to make something that We should have a back-up plan of just a really good television remote control, that just that is just for a T_V_, but it's just a really good, nice one.
Market range internationally sold.
but the the functions that we're sure that we want are that it can control the T_V_, but also devices connected to the to the T_V_, I mean, be able to operate
like a lock f like a lock functs function on it like you have on your telephones,
I've had word down from head office that something that we should be centred well, something we should take into account is we've gotta keep the corporate image within this remote control unit. It's gotta d look like it's in the R_ and R_. so, I mean, we are sort of beholden to them. Not one colour, but the pattern needs to be recognisable. but you have to look at the product and instantly know that it's one of our products
energy source, that would be batteries.
Yeah, and basically, as far as methods, I was I was looking looking at looking at already existing remotes, trying to find some inspiration from designs that are already out there. And so in the research that I was doing there's basically two types of remotes, I mean people want a remote that's familiar, that has their favourite functionalities and and does the basics, but so things that seem like absolute must-haves would be a volume control, channel keys up-down, but then also a numerical key pad so that they can just key directly to the channel that they want, rather than doing up-down, ones that are engineering centred and ones that are more user centred, judging from what what we all talked about during our last meeting I kind of gathered that that's what we were going after, So, the engineering centred ones provide a lot of functionality, so the user centred ones just focus on ease of use. have you found that anyone else has do has looked into the locking function or No that that that seemed like a novel idea as f as far as I know. what do you guys have a a yea or nay on that a feeling about whether that's really necessary? I would say it's If it's simple to do, and what I didn't mention yet really is is the sort of like the ergonomic design.
I'm gonna draw it on the board then. So the idea is that we've got the energy source, So I think maybe two batteries, then on the remote control itself will have the sender for the signal, which could be an infra-red signal, which will be sent by an electronic chip. Is a battery like the only way of No 'cause like cha 'cause always changing batteries can get like annoying. swi I th I th I think changing your batteries once every six months is not really a pain, but as far as the infra-red signal, do we have control over, you know, how far away you can be from the receiving unit, the the T_V_, and still have it be operational? It's never gonna be more than it's never gonna be, you kno unless you've got a T_V_ the size of a football pitch, it's not doesn't have to go that far, Well, we can make the the signal strong enough to go through walls if if you fancy it. Yeah, yeah I d it sounds like you you w don't wanna overcomplicate things. How about Bluetooth? Doesn't have to go through a wall, because you're not gonna be looking through a wall.
Voice activation might not be the best. I would say scra I'd say scrap that straight off.
so I just wanna rather than going Miss Marketing and Miss this and Miss that wanted to know your names again. Okay, right, welcome to meeting B_. this is gonna go a lot better than the last meeting, basically, 'cause I know what I'm supposed to be doing now. and, yeah, I'm just here to sort of liaise between the three of you and get things going, get people talking and and I'm gonna be making notes and sending them off to the powers that be and stuff basically. what this meeting is all about is I'm gonna have some presentations from all three of you, We'll we'll talk about what we actually need as a final coming together of it all. So I want each of your presentations to not be too long, five five minutes, something like that. This meeting it's not very long. It's probably down to about thirty five minutes now. if you haven't done a PowerPoint thingy, it doesn't matter,
we should probably consult with our legal department. I'll see if I can get see if I can get hold of them for the next meeting.
we've decided that it's gonna be, you know, we're going for a basic television remote. I think, we should just go with the simplest option on everything, and that would be infra-red, energy source, that would be batteries. mean we we can look into using the s, you know, the little tiny weeny batteries, all like special long-lasting batteries.. So are we headed towards like a b a big yellow and black remote as far as I I kind of thought it was blue writing on a yellow background, Well, it's like white on i white and blue on a black background with white with yellow borders. Can't we have different colours in the remotes, And this is something that came on down from from the higher ups, so, I mean, we are sort of beholden to them. So we have to have it one colour. Not one colour, but the pattern needs to be recognisable. but you have to look at the product and instantly know that it's one of our products so maybe, so you can have a look at our our other products and see if they all follow a s similar vein, perhaps. But it could come in different colours and have the R_R_ colours just somewhere
Well, for our marketing report we observed remote control users in a usability lab, So seventy five per cent of users find the remote control ugly. current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user. eighty f eighty per cent of them would spend more money if the rem remote control looked really cool and fancy. I was thinking something easy to use, especially for older people. has to look really cool, flashy groovy for people to buy it. and also we asked them whether they wanted whether they'd be interested in voice activating. What about just from the the prospective of our manufacturing cost? most people that have the money are people from the age of thirty five to fifty five, It's older generation, they're the ones that have gone out and but the younger generation who we are catering for, like who have most of the money nowadays, do want a voice act speech recognition in a remote. Voice activation might not be the best. I would say scra I'd say scrap that straight off. also with with buttons, a thing called R_S_I_, I think we can do some really in in that department, the the ergonomic department, we can make some some really good improvements.
I've had word down from head office that something that we should be centred well, something we should take into account is we've gotta keep the corporate image within this remote control unit. It's gotta d look like it's in the R_ and R_., everything is going t ergonomic, you know,
So are we headed towards like a b a big yellow and black remote as far as Can't we have different colours in the remotes, I I kind of thought it was blue writing on a yellow background, Well, it's like white on i white and blue on a black background with white with yellow borders. And this is something that came on down from from the higher ups, so, I mean, we are sort of beholden to them. So we have to have it one colour. Not one colour, but the pattern needs to be recognisable. but you have to look at the product and instantly know that it's one of our products so maybe, so you can have a look at our our other products and see if they all follow a s similar vein, perhaps. But it could come in different colours and have the R_R_ colours just somewhere
and also we asked them whether they wanted whether they'd be interested in voice activating. What about just from the the prospective of our manufacturing cost? most people that have the money are people from the age of thirty five to fifty five, It's older generation, they're the ones that have gone out and but the younger generation who we are catering for, like who have most of the money nowadays, do want a voice act speech recognition in a remote. Voice activation might not be the best. I would say scra I'd say scrap that straight off.
, everything is going t ergonomic, you know, and that could be one of our niches p sort of in the market, I guess.. I think we can do some really in in that department, the the ergonomic department, we can make some some really good improvements.
as far as the infra-red signal, do we have control over, you know, how far away you can be from the receiving unit, the the T_V_, and still have it be operational? It's never gonna be more than it's never gonna be, you kno unless you've got a T_V_ the size of a football pitch, it's not doesn't have to go that far, Well, we can make the the signal strong enough to go through walls if if you fancy it.
have you found that anyone else has do has looked into the locking function or No that that that seemed like a novel idea as f as far as I know. what do you guys have a a yea or nay on that a feeling about whether that's really necessary? I would say it's If it's simple to do,
and that could be one of our niches p sort of in the market, I guess.. I think we can do some really in in that department, the the ergonomic department, we can make some some really good improvements.
and that would be infra-red, Yeah, yeah I d it sounds like you you w don't wanna overcomplicate things. It's never gonna be more than it's never gonna be, you kno unless you've got a T_V_ the size of a football pitch, it's not doesn't have to go that far, Doesn't have to go through a wall, because you're not gonna be looking through a wall.
Well, what do we need a speaker for in a remote control unit? What about the just developed sample sensor? it would be one thing if it was speech recognition where you say something and it turns the T_V_ on like, turn the T_V_ on, and i turns comes on, I'm just guessing. But it's gonna be the most expensive option, probably and a it just gives you a verbal response. Oh, then forget about it.
Yeah, I would say mayb maybe a couple of colours like like a black with with yellow and somewhere, Wanna make it different colours so anybody can choo like like so we could do like the pink range, the blue range, the green range, the where, you know, you have a variety of colours, that people feel like they're customising it when they buy it, even, you know, just just by the fact of choosing.
Gabriel, you're gonna be working on, you know come up with the the user interface design.
so for the energy sources we can have a basic battery, a hand dynamo which is which was used in the fifties for torches, You can have a kinetic provision of energy, Or you can use solar cells, but I'm not sure about that indoors, really, but Well, there's sometimes combinations, I mean, like calculators do combinations of battery with but also using some solar power. And if we want something fancier, I think the kinetic provision of energy could be nice, Think the the what would cost the less would be the basic battery, really. For the case of the remotes itself, they can be a general case, which is just a flat one. You can have a curved one or a double curved one, then the case material itself, so it can be either plastic or latex, rubber, wood, or titanium. And th for each of them you have cases where for example titanium, you can't use it for if you if we're choosing a double curved case, we can't choose titanium. But if we're choosing just the flat case then we can go for anything. so you can have basic push-buttons or a scroll-wheels, like you have on a mouse, or you could have L_C_D_, which gives you a display. and if we choose double curved then we have to go for rubber push-buttons. so the push-buttons themselves they can be just simple or they can be If we get an advanced chip which is used for the L_C_D_, the display thing, then that's even more expensive.
alright first off we'll just recap from our last meeting. which was we got together just to basically decide on well to talk about what it is that we were actually supposed to be doing,
Okay, so I'm continuing with the user interface topic. and so the manufacturing division sent some some samples of of interface components that we might be interested in using that have been used in other products, like the coffee machine. they they suggested the idea of using a spinning wheel like you use on the side of an M_P_ three player like iPod. So I already mentioned the speech recognition interface. I guess, we we basically vetoed that idea. but they suggested, you know, going i a little bit into a a niche, but it sounded like from our last meeting we really wanted something that was general, but done well. I can give you an example here of, good layout and bad layout So this would be an example of bad layout, where you have volume up and volume down, but they have a V_ on both of them, so this is the example of the giant remote that's impossible to lose. so I was against the speech recognition and against going towards anything in in a niche sense. I didn't I didn't think the spinning-wheel or the L_C_ display were were crucial for us. So we're we're not gonna have any sort of display I think. I think we shall have a limited number of buttons, ideally, I mean a a power, channel up, channel down, volume up, volume down, and a numerical keypad. it will either have a a lock button like we mentioned or or a cover or something like that. it seems like we wouldn't wanna make it too busy and too sort of gaudy, Yeah, I would say mayb maybe a couple of colours like like a black with with yellow and somewhere, I I guess the fact also that we are having a rubber case would prevent us from having the cover function that we thought of before.
So that might be an idea of using the rubber, And also it doesn't break as easily maybe, Rubber, we're all we're all going we're all liking that idea? Mean so what's the difference between a normal rubber case and a rubble doub double rubber double curved case? Let's have rubber push buttons, hey. is, okay, advanced chip on print, which I presume is like one P_C_B_ and that's got all the electronics on one board including the infra-red sender? Well, if if it's not chip on print then, I guess, you get different chip components, and you build them separately and doesn't include the infra-red. If it's something that's inside the the unit. I it doesn't affects whether the customer's gonna buy it or not. So let's not let's not bother with the chip on print. What about the just developed sample sensor? I'm just guessing. But it's gonna be the most expensive option, probably and it would be one thing if it was speech recognition where you say something and it turns the T_V_ on like, turn the T_V_ on, and i turns comes on, a it just gives you a verbal response. Oh, then forget about it. So rubber rubber keys, yeah. so we want it rub rubber double curved. But the fact that this this rubber i is actually used in these anti-R_S_I_ ps specific
now the trouble is is we've already decided that we're going with the stuff that works already, that's cheap. I mean it's different, but I wouldn't say like a rubber remote is fancy. That's why I was thinking, Bluetooth, 'cause Bluetooth is the in thing nowadays, like it really is, they don't really care whether, you know, at the end of the day whether it works properly or not. Of course, they do. So is is the advantage of Bluetooth that you can just like synchronise it with other that would mean you'd need a television that has Bluetooth in it, which no no television does, Well, if you're looking at if you looking at something that's going to be bought by people, you have to make it new, you have to make it state of the art. Like it doesn't have to be, you know, Bluetooth, If we want something new, we need to move away from what we already have
Well, I'm just basically letting you know what's happening in the markets So the remote control has to look and feel fancier than the ones that already that we already have. second, it should be technologically innovative innovative. Next year's fashion i very much in fruit and vegetables are thm are like the theme for cloths, shoes and furniture. Okay, so we could have keys that are like a b like a broccoli key and a and an avocado key on them. and as it's rubber the feel which is in this year is spongy, Yeah, we're we're ahead of the game there.
That's why I was thinking, Bluetooth, 'cause Bluetooth is the in thing nowadays, like it really is, they don't really care whether, you know, at the end of the day whether it works properly or not. Of course, they do. So is is the advantage of Bluetooth that you can just like synchronise it with other that would mean you'd need a television that has Bluetooth in it, which no no television does, Well, if you're looking at if you looking at something that's going to be bought by people, you have to make it new, you have to make it state of the art. Like it doesn't have to be, you know, Bluetooth,
from you Catherine wi your y y you know you're gonna be working on the the look and feel design.
and I'm not sure about the buttons being in the shape of fruit though. Maybe make it like fruity colours or something. The power button could be like a big apple or something. like I'm just thinking bright colours. Wanna make it different colours so anybody can choo like like so we could do like the pink range, the blue range, the green range, the where, you know, you have a variety of colours, that people feel like they're customising it when they buy it, even, you know, just just by the fact of choosing.
Let's have rubber push buttons, hey. So rubber rubber keys, yeah.
Rubber, we're all we're all going we're all liking that idea? so we want it rub rubber double curved.
and I'm not sure about the buttons being in the shape of fruit though. Maybe make it like fruity colours or something. The power button could be like a big apple or something. like I'm just thinking bright colours.
Then basically, you two are gonna be working together on this. come up ki you know, be ab for the next meeting be able to come in and show us some some i some physical ideas. and I think you are gonna get a chance to play with some clay.
and you're gonna be working on the product evaluation.
so we want it rub rubber double curved.
So we're we're not gonna have any sort of display I think.
So let's not let's not bother with the chip on print.
Okay. Yeah, this that's that's very good. right, we're gonna go go back to going with the kinetic thing,
We've got a cool prototype. everything that we wanted we wanted it to be ergonomic and to be made out of rubber, Double curved. but also something that was gonna jump out at people, So I think if you put this in the palm of your hand, you'll see what a nice thing we have going here. So, basically, if you hold it like that, the one on your thumb, yeah, the thumb button is the power button. Your index finger is channel up, middle finger is channel down, and then then you can also there's a numeric keypad on the top so you can key directly to the to the channel if you want. but we think it's very comfortable and very innovative and it looks different. That certainly does. I think it's, well, if the R_R_ motto is, we bring fashion to to electronics, I'd say that could be quite fashionable. And it's got the b the black and yellow and blue.
but it'd mean we'd have to make a right-handed one and a left-handed one. But, that's I don't see why that's not possible. like I was just thinking if there's left-handers and right-handers in the family, what, they have two remotes? Yeah, I know I know people who have left-handed and right-handed people in the family and they all use the computer for the whole the same computer the fes family and they have a mouse, and everybody is using right-handed mouse. I think everybody can press a button with their left and right hand so But we can have both Have them in stock.
Okay, I I think I just wanna put in as Project Manager the you know, little bit of praise for everybody here for how they've worked on it, during our design I mean there was some s some heated heated discussion, but we we kept we tried to keep it cool and and and then come together and worked in, you know, integrally, you know, at the right times, and be you know, has been good communication going on. Now you guys have been a a great team. and I think we've co we have come we've come up with something new, something that hasn't been done before, I think actually and one advantage of of this is that after the, you know, after this fad of fruit and vegetables passes this will still be c a cool remote, you know. how does everyone feel about the technology that's been used in this? The sort of using of the the pens and writing on these special pads and all that? I love it. I love it. I think it's cool., but a p a pen with a camera on it, I don't think it's such a new thing. It would be different if it was sort of hand writing recognition stuff, but as it's not it's literally that'll come up on a computer screen as a picture file rather than actual text. I think they do want to do hand writing recognition on that, it's just the first step.
w every everything else was fairly simple, but the fact that we used the kinetic energy was new. not if you're left-handed it's not. So that's the evaluation, We've, we've done well. Number one product.
so we evaluate each criteria. And we have to do it on a scale of one to seven, one being true, so it's it's more like it's fits the criteria, and seven being as in it doesn't fit the criteria. So the does remote look and feel fashionable to what we talked about? I would give it a seven. As in it's not. Oh sorry, one, d yeah. Second criteria, new technology. Well, the kinetic thing, yeah. Maybe three, yeah. So criteria three is is it easy to use? If we're gonna have one left-handed and one right-handed then I would give it a one, but otherwise otherwise a two. 'Kay, criteria four is costs. It's come in under budget. So that's a definite one. Amount of buttons. Contains only the necessary buttons. R_S_I_ is it good against? Yes. Very good. does it get lost? I don't think it's gonna get lost easily. But it is smallish. I mean, you could still flush it down the toilet theoretically, but
One thing I do need to do we need to look at, is the costs. I could do you know, I can do this o on my own or I could do it with you, but it's just easy enough to go through it with you, so we're going for the kinetic power. So the case, we've gone for the double curved. and it's made out of rubber. well they're in diff special colours, Special form, We're under budget. That's gonna cost ten ten Euro seventy cents a unit to make. And our target was it had to come in at under twelve fifty.
I have one thing about it, but it's a small thing, but it'd mean we'd have to make a right-handed one and a left-handed one. But, that's I don't see why that's not possible. like I was just thinking if there's left-handers and right-handers in the family, what, they have two remotes? Yeah, I know I know people who have left-handed and right-handed people in the family and they all use the computer for the whole the same computer the fes family and they have a mouse, and everybody is using right-handed mouse. I think everybody can press a button with their left and right hand so But we can have both Have them in stock.
the User Interface Designer, that's for. Technical functions, I guess like keeping in mind the buttons thing, the size of the buttons.
I'll look into that.
the industrial design, Alima will be doing the working design.
just to generate a little bit of discussion about the project, I could I'd like to hear about your experiences using ro remote controls, what would be the best like you what are the features that you really like I hate when there's like four different buttons and you have to press to actually turn on the T_V_ 'cause I feel like you end up with multimedia overload. especially, like you know if I'm watching T_V_ I have have to have three separate remote controls of in front of me, you know, one for the T_V_, one for the digital box, one for m the video recorder as well.. And also they tend to they tend to be a bit confusing, too too sort of too sort of complicated they've got too many buttons on them and that there's not too many buttons, they are not too small, like are there some remotes that don don't require like batteries but it's possible we could use like a lithium battery it seems we have a little bit of a conflict over to combining all the remotes cont together versus having f five different remotes. I guess we have to define what what we're aiming for.
it seems we have a little bit of a conflict over to combining all the remotes cont together versus having f five different remotes. doesn't have all the buttons that you need to program the video recorder but that just has your major buttons for that work for everything, you know volume control, on, off, so it's like if you're looki if you're trying to get the T_V_ on that's, you know, like the top thing on the remote, I dunno if d be vertical or horizontal in terms of how we're gonna make it, but if it's like all the T_V_ stuff was here, then all the V_C_R_ stuff was here, all the whatever else we have programmed into it it's all just in its separate place and not like all the on buttons together, and if if you'd save the more complicated functions maybe for separate remotes that you wouldn't need to use every day. would we even technically be possible to include video recorder functions on it? are we designing a remote control for a television only or should we just stick to just stick to having television television related buttons on it? I'll look into that. If it's just a television then that it's a bit simpler, If you have older people or people like me that aren't very co-ordinated hand-eye, it's really quite important that you are not pressing a small like teeny mobiles phone size buttons, if we can help it. so maybe have like one remote that has the main functions on, off, channel changing, volume, and another rote remote with all the special things.
we're gonna do a little tool training, so we are gonna work with that whiteboard behind you. introduce yourself, and then draw your favourite animal My name is Alima Bucciantini. and I guess I'm the Industrial Designer on this project. I will draw a little turtle for you all. my name is Iain and I'm the User Interface Designer for the project.. It's a whale, yes. I'm Jessy. Briefly, it's supposed to be a seal.
and if if you'd save the more complicated functions maybe for separate remotes that you wouldn't need to use every day.
We're gonna talk about project finances. we'd like to sell it for about twenty five Euro with the profit aim of fifteen million Euro from our sales and because this is such this is for television it's a we have a market range of Internet, like it's an international market range, in order to make a profit of this magnitude, we need to be able to produce each one at a maximum of twelve fifty Euro.
so maybe have like one remote that has the main functions on, off, channel changing, volume, and another rote remote with all the special things.
Good morning everybody. I'm just gonna have a little PowerPoint presentation for us, for our kick-off meeting. My name is Rose Lindgren. I I'll be the Project Manager. our agenda today is we are gonna do a little opening and then I'm gonna talk a little bit about the project, then we'll move into acquaintance such as getting to know each other a little bit, including a tool training exercise. And then we'll move into the project plan, do a little discussion
in order to make a profit of this magnitude, we need to be able to produce each one at a maximum of twelve fifty Euro.
we are creating a new remote control which we have three goals about, it needs to be original, trendy and user-friendly. so we're gonna divide us up into three compa three parts. First the functional design which will be first we'll do individual work, come into a meeting, the conceptional design, individual work and a meeting, and then the detailed design, individual work and a meeting.
and because this is such this is for television it's a we have a market range of Internet, like it's an international market range,
would we even technically be possible to include video recorder functions on it? are we designing a remote control for a television only or should we just stick to just stick to having television television related buttons on it? I'll look into that. If it's just a television then that it's a bit simpler, If you have older people or people like me that aren't very co-ordinated hand-eye, it's really quite important that you are not pressing a small like teeny mobiles phone size buttons, if we can help it.
it seems we have a little bit of a conflict over to combining all the remotes cont together versus having f five different remotes. doesn't have all the buttons that you need to program the video recorder but that just has your major buttons for that work for everything, you know volume control, on, off, so it's like if you're looki if you're trying to get the T_V_ on that's, you know, like the top thing on the remote, I dunno if d be vertical or horizontal in terms of how we're gonna make it, but if it's like all the T_V_ stuff was here, then all the V_C_R_ stuff was here, all the whatever else we have programmed into it it's all just in its separate place and not like all the on buttons together, and if if you'd save the more complicated functions maybe for separate remotes that you wouldn't need to use every day. so maybe have like one remote that has the main functions on, off, channel changing, volume, and another rote remote with all the special things.
we'd like to sell it for about twenty five Euro with the profit aim of fifteen million Euro from our sales
we'd like to sell it for about twenty five Euro with the profit aim of fifteen million Euro from our sales
Can you e-mail your slides as well? Yes, I yes, I think I can. I'll just attach it to an email. and probably email those out to all of you. just including all the things that we talked about..
user requirements, so you'll be hearing about different trends, about different things that people need,
that's that's a good idea, But you could maybe have it in a little charging station like a mobile phone, or like a little cradle for your iPod.
'Cause then 's like people who don't wanna ever look at them, never even have to see them and then you could like pull something out, that had like the main buttons like if it was just a simple, either this way or this way, Which are kind of hidden away in some way
Are we gonna use that as one of our functions? I I would say no, because it's gonna add too much to the price. And I wonder if we can get voice recognition into that twelve and a half Euros without having to make too many other compromises. And if the whole idea is you're using a remote then why would you have voice, like you know what I mean and then it's like you wouldn't need a remote It's for, like, the ultimately lazy people,
if we're gonna say that function fashion we put the fashion in in electronics then you automatically, I think, a sort of younger group that that's who's gonna be attracted to this. I do think, who's gonna have the money to buy that also, that one? The only break-down that I was given in terms of age was the voice activation so it's like basically fifteen to thirty five that think that that's a good idea. that's probably a population w quite a little bit of disposable income for use on technology anyway, So our target group, we're saying, fifteen to thirty five? I dunno how useful that number is if we're not doing S voice recognition, but I th I think regardless we're we're aiming for the under sixty five or something. can we narrow it down to maybe teenagers and families? It's it's hard to narrow it down.
We want a possibility to to get a possibility to get the extra functions.
And we want we want large buttons for the essential things.
so we want something to keep it from getting lost.
and finally there's more marketing, I think,, our corporate image has to be recognisable. while we're gonna make it look pretty we need to use our colour and our slogan i in the new design.
like your question earlier whether this is going to be t for television, video, or etcetera. Just for television. That's what we're focused on.
Si simplicity and fashion. I think the product appeals across a quite a broad range of ages. so it's going to appeal to people, maybe people who have problems with technology, you know, people who get scared by having lots of buttons, maybe we don't have to defi define the target group by the demographic of age, So maybe it's more useful to d d to define objectives like fashion and simplicity than to find specific target group as far as age is
Si simplicity and fashion.
User Interface, the user interface concept,
I_ I_D_ Industrial Design you've your components concept,
We didn't bring it up yet, or at all in the meetings so far, but we're not gonna work with teletext
market trend wa watching.
If everyone could do that as well, that'd be great.
I had a look on the on the web to see if I could find a few examples of existing television remote controls. In analysing these we can consider what what things what's good about them, how we can improve on the designs that that that I found Here's two examples probably at the extreme ends of the spectrum. on the left here we've got an engineering-based design for a remote control, so it's one that's got lots of buttons, The one on the right is a lot more basic. It would be a lot quicker to learn to use it, there's a lot of features that are missing from that remote control. everything you might possibly want to do is there,
this is our working design presentation. I had a bit of some issues with this, because I wasn't able to find everything I needed, what we're trying to do as a working design is figure out how the aparata apparatus can fulfil its function. one of the examples that kept coming up for me is that a coffee grinder. because it converts electrical energy to grinding the beans because of the combination of electrical energy and then the other things that are brought in to make it work. So you make a schematic of the way that the the energy is converted tsh towards this practical function. the findings that I got very just very briefly is that you have a choice of the way that the information is projected to the receiver and in my opinion infra-red is the best way to do that the user interface is critical here, because a lot of the things that happen in a remote control happen through the chip that controls that converts the electrical energy into data, the components that we find here are the energy source, you know the battery or whatever that's gonna m make it work, then the chip, which converts the data, the user that's controlling the chip, and the infra-red bulb that's gonna let us move the data to the receiver. And personal preferences, besides the fact that I can't spell, we need a long-lasting energy source, We need a chip that works well with the user interface, and we need a reliable and clear infra-red signal,
requirements. We have a couple new requirements but we're not gonna work with teletext We didn't bring it up yet, or at all in the meetings so far, What's teletext?, it's a British thing. I suppose it's kind of similar to a very very basic web browser. this this kind of index appears on the television screen with just some some text and some very blocky looking graphics on it. and it gives you information, mostly rather boring stuff like what's on T_V_ next and share prices and that kind of thing. It's earl it's pretty old technology. like your question earlier whether this is going to be t for television, video, or etcetera. Just for television. That's what we're focused on. otherwise becomes to complex, and finally there's more marketing, I think,, our corporate image has to be recognisable. while we're gonna make it look pretty we need to use our colour and our slogan i in the new design. It's It's kind of yellow colour with we put fashion in electronics. and we have that the emphasis on the R_s in Looks like, yeah, kind of a yellow and black It's like double R_. we need to talk about our functions and our target group. You in your analysis of different market of the marketing, you identified that different groups wanted different things if we're gonna say that function fashion we put the fashion in in electronics then you automatically, I think, a sort of younger group that that's who's gonna be attracted to this. I do think, who's gonna have the money to buy that also, that one? at least right now what we're doing is deciding on just the remote itself, The only break-down that I was given in terms of age was the voice activation so it's like basically fifteen to thirty five that think that that's a good idea. that's probably a population w quite a little bit of disposable income for use on technology anyway, that's all specific for speech recognition. Are we gonna use that as one of our functions? I I would
after the meeting we're gonna each complete a sks a questionnaire and a summaries summary.
After that we have thirty minutes of individual work.
I'll make sure to put up the minutes and the project documentation and including these PowerPoint slides.
Battery? Do we need a long-life battery? We should maybe investigate whether it needs a battery at all. But you could maybe have it in a little charging station like a mobile phone, or like a little cradle for your iPod. Yeah, that's that's possible. Yeah. that might contribute to less people losing it too if it it stays in one place.
This is our functional design meeting. our agenda today. I'm gonna do an opening, did you all get the minutes? I e-mailed them to you. I'm also putting 'em them in the shared folder. So then I we'll talk about our general objectives and have your three presentations. I'll talk about the new project requirements I've just received, and then we have to make a decision on our remote control functions. we need to keep in mind the user requirement specification, what needs and desires are to be fulfilled, the functions design, what effects the apparatus should have, and the working design, how the apparatus actually works to fulfil its function.
which includes an emphasis on making the infra-red very functional, What can you do to like make the infra-red more functional, I think it's a lot to do with battery, So 's just the quality of the chip.
I don't know if you guys are able to get access to the report that was online or if I'm the only one who is. we're just gonna talk a little bit about the functional requirements that people specified when they were asked. They had a hundred subjects and their usability lab and recorded the frequency that they used particular buttons and the relevance that those buttons had. Focusing on their desires, people specifically said that they thought remotes were ugly, seventy five per cent of the a hundred subjects noted that more importantly though, eighty per cent said that they would be willing to pay more for a fancier looking remote. and found that the desire for voice recognition was inversely related to age, so younger people were more inclined to want something with voice recognition, That being people k frustrated with losing their remotes. I think, over fifty percent of the people mentioned that that was their biggest frustration. People are also frustrated with the difficulty it is to learn how to use a remote and I think that ties back to what you were saying before just that there's too many buttons, It also mentioned something called R_S_I_ and I was hoping someone might be able to inform me as to what R_S_I_ is, Repetitive strain injury. So I guess sort of the carpal tunnel type thing, people do not like that, looking at the needs people specified, the problem right now is that people's remotes are not matching their operating behaviour. People are only using ten per cent of the buttons that they have offered to them on their remote. People also zap like to change the channel, about sixty five per cent during an hour of use. So we really just need to focus in on those volumes and channel changers rather than things like the audio settings, the screen settings and the channel settings, the idea of an L_C_D_ screen was brought up although they didn't have any details on what people's preferences on that were, also just the phenomenon that less is more when
I'm gonna talk about the technical technical functions design of the remote control. We need to start by considering what a remote control actually is. It's a device that allows us to produce certain effects on our television, it sends a message to the television First thing to do is to come up with the design specifications. so we need a a clear idea of exactly what this product does, and what the end-user is gonna want from this product. a way I'd suggest that we could go about this is by designing several different prototypes of user interfaces for this product, and then trying to get some feedback about h how well these particular prototypes work, When a users using a remote control, he or she expects the buttons to be in certain places. So in some sense we're gonna we're gonna have to aim for a device which is fairly conventional in design But I think within that there is also room for us to introduce novel ideas also in in designing the user interface we need to consider practicalities. the first of these is is technological we need to find a balance between features and price. things like voice recognition would would add to the price but it would also im improve the design of the product. personally wa what I want from a remote control is a device that's simple, it's got big buttons for doing the things I do most often, changing the volume, changing the channel. that's ergonomically designed. I think there's there's certainly a market for technology that looks cool.
my understanding of a latex case is that it's in fact hard to protect stuff inside, there's something to be said, I mean we we got that thing earlier from you about not wanting it to R_ R_ repetitive stress injuries and things and then like the the covers could be spongy latex I'm kinda liking the idea of latex, if if spongy is the in thing. could it be hard, and then something around it? I would be more okay with like a titanium actual thing and then maybe like a mobile phone kind of thing. what I've seen, just not related to this, but of latex cases before, is that there's like a hard plastic inside, and it's just covered with the latex.
I think that's that's one way to go, So you'd be advocating an L_C_D_ then? we'd either have a small L_C_D_ display on the device itself, or have a dis a menu display that comes up on your television I mean there are there are advantages and disadvantages if you if you have an L_C_D_ display, an an L_C_D_ display would have to be quite small, it would also have to have a kind of backlighting in it, The alternative is to have a an on-screen display on your television that you control through your remote control. but I think th that you do need to have some kind of function where it's you have t you can see the title of the show or possibly a description of it. I think I think we're talking menu like contrast and tuning the V_C_R_ or something if I've understood you correctly, rather than menu as what's on.
or is it li more like a scroll thing? I love the idea of the wheel like the iPod. and you press the centre button, that's that's your all-purpose select button right there. I think why it would be good for us is 'cause like you could have the same wheel sort of effect for like channel flipping and then the other one could be like for volume. Do we want a scroll wheel, I don't think we ne really need the scroll whe wheel. It would be nice for changing the volume, but I don't know how useful it'd be for changing the channel. you really need buttons for changing a channel. and the volume would just be like the same way, forward and backward as I'm just thinking like it would make it much like sleeker sort of looking. When you get on the on-screen menu of all your functions that your remote could do for you without the buttons and you could have a scroll wheel to go through those menus. I think yeah, I think a scroll wheel would be nice, but it's not necessary. And I think if we wanna keep our costs down, we should just go for pushbuttons, For channel surfing I think a scroll an actual like an iPod's kind of scroll thing would be too fast, I think it might be better to put our money into the stuff like the kinetic battery and the cool case I mean I'm not like hard-sold on the scroll wheel, it's more just to give it a different kind of look, but if it's gonna be in a latex type thing and that's gonna look cool, then that's probably gonna have a bigger impact than the scroll wheel.
I guess maybe if we decided on like a simple, a regular, or an advanced chip, maybe. if we're gonna have pushbuttons, they require a simple chip, but a scroll wheel requires a regular chip,
my understanding of a latex case is that it's in fact hard to protect stuff inside, Al all circuit boards are pretty much the same, I think. I don't really know what to tell you as far as decisions.
do you have any ideas how to possibly use these? how to how to use a fruit or vegetable or or the spongy material at all? could we go in fruit and vegetable colours? couple main ones being like, I dunno, lemons or strawberries or something. I Is it supposed to be shaped like a vegetable? like I dunno, like carrots or something. Or maybe the buttons could be shaped like different fruits. What about the idea of like a round remote? Instead of like a vertical up and down one. Like in terms of holding it. Like that's a f shape of a fruit. would you think you you do you think you'd be able to hold it? Could Could we could we have changeable covers like for your mobile? In different fruit and vegetable colours, and then like the the covers could be spongy latex and probably in colours, maybe fruity, vegetable colours.
and we want a curved case, Or a double-curved?
Let's go with a simple chip? did we decide on a chip?
we'd either have a small L_C_D_ display on the device itself, or have a dis a menu display that comes up on your television there's no point having a television that you can't tune or that you can't set the contrast, so we need to find a way of including these somehow. So you'd be advocating an L_C_D_ then? I think that's that's one way to go, I mean there are there are advantages and disadvantages if you if you have an L_C_D_ display, an an L_C_D_ display would have to be quite small, it would also have to have a kind of backlighting in it, The alternative is to have a an on-screen display on your television that you control through your remote control. but I think th that you do need to have some kind of function where it's you have t you can see the title of the show or possibly a description of it. I think I think we're talking menu like contrast and tuning the V_C_R_ or something if I've understood you correctly, rather than menu as what's on.
we're gonna look a little bit at trend watching. that was a market investigation on remote controls that was recently conducted, and then also some fashion watchers in Paris and Milan commented on some things that are gonna be going on this year. and right now i d they're saying that currently there's a functional look and feel preference, but that really, over the next year it it that's gonna be switching to fancy look and feel remotes, they're sort of wanting us to remember that the number one thing for everyone is that it's fancy look and feel. And as these are ranked, the top one is doubly important to the second one, which is doubly important to the third one, The second thing that was mentioned as important was the technological innovations. And then ease of use was the third most important, And then the fashion watch talks about that this year's top trend for clothes, shoes and furniture is fruits and vegetables and tha that there's a preference for spongy, tight material. And so that brings us to my personal preferences. Who wants a spongy remote or one with fruit and vegetable padding. Personally, I don't really think that I want one that's gonna go out of style or go stale, excuse the pun, in a year, so and if necessarily this whole fashion to technology y edas ease of use is necessarily the right ranking. Also, considering that the d research b has been carried out by Real Reaction, I'm a little hesitant as to like, how these questions may have been worded, but if we're working for this company then I guess no matter what, we have to stress fashion the most.
do you have any ideas how to possibly use these? how to how to use a fruit or vegetable or or the spongy material at all? could we make a s like could we make a spongy remote? If it's latex if it's latexy my understanding of a latex case is that it's in fact hard to protect stuff inside, there's something to be said, I mean we we got that thing earlier from you about not wanting it to R_ R_ repetitive stress injuries and things I'm envisioning more like, you know, the material that you have when you sit on like a bicycle, could we go in fruit and vegetable colours? couple main ones being like, I dunno, lemons or strawberries or something. I Is it supposed to be shaped like a vegetable? like I dunno, like carrots or something. Or maybe the buttons could be shaped like different fruits. What about the idea of like a round remote? Instead of like a vertical up and down one. Like in terms of holding it. Like that's a f shape of a fruit. would you think you you do you think you'd be able to hold it? Could Could we could we have changeable covers like for your mobile? In different fruit and vegetable colours,
I love the idea of the wheel like the iPod. or is it li more like a scroll thing? and you press the centre button, that's that's your all-purpose select button right there. I think why it would be good for us is 'cause like you could have the same wheel sort of effect for like channel flipping and then the other one could be like for volume. I think an L_C_D_ screen might be good in theory, but not as useful in practice. I've one more slide before we close, but in that slide is when we need to make decisions about this these kinds of things, and then like the the covers could be spongy latex components concept. Energy, chip on print. can you just explain what that is real quick? what do people think about this kinetic battery idea? I think it's awesome. I think it's really cool. as as long as we consider the the cost and the how reliable it is, I got a whole bunch of information on how circuit boards are produced. which is chip on print is where the machine prints on the wires and solders it all together for us. Al all circuit boards are pretty much the same, I think. I don't really know what to tell you as far as decisions. I guess maybe if we decided on like a simple, a regular, or an advanced chip, maybe. if we're gonna have pushbuttons, they require a simple chip, but a scroll wheel requires a regular chip, Do we want a scroll wheel, I don't think we ne really need the scroll whe wheel. It would be nice for changing the volume, but I don't know how useful it'd be for changing the channel. you really need buttons for changing a channel. and the volume would just be like the same way, forward and backward as I'm just thinking like it would make it much like sleeker sort of looking. When you get on the on-screen menu of all your functions that your remote could do for you without the buttons
these are our minutes from r the functional design. We decided our target group is the focus on who can afford it, and we said it's for all age groups, different functions of it. Our main objectives were simplicity and fashion. specific functions are something to keep the remote from getting lost, large buttons for the essential functions, a possibility for extra functions, like a sliding a sliding piece and a long-life battery or a charging station.
Components design. The main elements of remote controls in general, and therefore ours as well, are the case, the buttons, the circuit board with the chip and the battery. the options that I've gotten from headquarters about what we can do, there's there's the shape of a case, we could do a flat sh a flat case, a curved case or maybe even a double double-curved case. I haven't seen any pictures of what this exactly looks like yet, and we can make our case out of plastic, the m the main base will be plastic, but we have all these sort of fashion and technological elements we can add in, wood, latex, titanium, rubber or other coloured types of plastic. for buttons we have pushbuttons, but we also have scror scroll wheels, which can have integrated pushbuttons, and have an L_ L_C_D_ screen. or we could go all high-tech circuit board and chip we can have a simple one, a regular one or an advanced one, And then battery I think is where things get most exciting. we can we can have your sort of basic double A_ batteries, but we also have these options of using a kinetic battery, so simple movements like pushing buttons would recharge the battery. Or a solar battery, although there are slight complications with solar batteries as in we can't use a latex case if we have a solar battery. Or something they only described as the type of battery you find in torches from about fifty years ago, flashlights. personal preferences that I was thinking through here's what we've been talking about all through, fashion and simplicity. So if we're going for fashion in our cases, I think that what we're gonna wanna look at is a curved or a double-curved case, probably with a variety of design elements. Maybe titanium, maybe some wood. We're gonna have to investigate that better when I get specifics of the actual materials, And we wanna go for simplicity. Probably pushbuttons, but I'm sort of intrigued by the idea of a scroll scroll wheel, if anyone has
I'm gonna describe the the concept of the user interface of this des device. so we need to determine what the essential functions of the d of the device are We have a number of different choices for a design concept once we've chosen a a concept for it, we can then design the features around the concept, M we don't want lots of buttons, complicated features. Here's a a fairly simple device. This is an an iPod from Apple. you use these four buttons to m to move around a range of settings on the small L_C_D_ screen. So I think that's that's a good a good kind of model that we could have. here's a another example. and I think i it looks pretty cool. it's nice and colourful, it's nice and bright. if you're watching T_V_ in the dark or whatever, you can work out which button's which I I like I like this idea of just having buttons for the features that you use most often.
you each have things to do, look and feel design, user interface design, product evaluation,
and you two are going to work together on a prototype using modelling clay.
you each have things to do, look and feel design, user interface design, product evaluation,
but if it's gonna be in a latex type thing and that's gonna look cool, then that's probably gonna have a bigger impact than the scroll wheel. I'm kinda liking the idea of latex, if if spongy is the in thing. what I've seen, just not related to this, but of latex cases before, is that there's like a hard plastic inside, and it's just covered with the latex.
what do people think about this kinetic battery idea? I think it's awesome. I think it's really cool. I think it might be better to put our money into the stuff like the kinetic battery and the cool case
We decided our target group is the focus on who can afford it,
you each have things to do, look and feel design, user interface design, product evaluation,
So we're gonna have like a menu button, volume, favourite channels, and menu. Pre-set channels
And I think if we wanna keep our costs down, we should just go for pushbuttons, we're gonna go with type pushbuttons,
and probably in colours, maybe fruity, vegetable colours.
otherwise the technology today was kinda cool. I got more master classes, what did I get through the corporate website? It's just inspiration about circuit boards. the Excel thing is pretty cool. I learned a lot actually. I could probably take apart a remote control now if I really needed to. I wrote it all down, because I thought it would be relevant, like all the different parts of the inside of a remote control, but then they're like, you don't actually need this I I thought it was a little tricky having to hand around this thing. We didn't we didn't use the whiteboard that much. Although I don't see how we could have very l at least for me and I think usually, like whiteboards are good, you know like crossing out ideas, or like if we had had like a brainstorming period. we could've put our brainstorming stuff up there rather than just talking about it, And with and with the PowerPoint that we can all look at, like you can do all those things pretty much on PowerPoint 'cause we all needed them separately, kind of on the whiteboards in this room. when you were creating your prototypes here, did you work together or did you like do separate projects? we we worked together, we sort of made different shapes well done with the management, I felt well managed. I think we did well in first of all giving our meetings the time, It's kinda fun. we we did a good job of making firm decisions at the ends of the meetings. I know what happens sometimes is that you tend to sort of have meetings and then people sorta drift away without anything actually really being decided. But I think here we got we got clear and and decisive decisive points at the end of the meetings, I think the last time we had a lot of information, but at the same time not quite enough, like we we couldn't answer every single question. And I I felt the first two meetings, that I was coming
and it's a special colour,
case material is rubber
Maybe it's single-curved, It's single curved.
let's have our buttons all be one colour.
We have six.
but if we had all the buttons in black, and a design in and the outside in yellow, that'd be our corporate one
and can we have like an R_R_ inscribed on the bottom or something? so let's let's make sure we keep that in mind that we ha that one of our colours concepts is corporate and has an R_R_ on it. I think all of them should have an R_R_.
we so we do we've decided not to worry about that for now. 'cause well, the designs are very bright, so you're right, they're gonna stick out,
is that where people are leaning then, the potato? Variety of colours are nice. I think I'm leaning towards the potato. that's really gotten the simplicity of the buttons down, that one. Potato.
It's gonna be somewhere that it can be seen. and we think that each of these are so distinctive, that it it's not just like another piece of technology around your house. we were we were talking about that a little bit but the f the feature that we considered for it not getting lost. So we're we're not thinking that it's gonna be as critical to have the loss Would it be very difficult to just have an external device that like I dunno, you tape to your to your T_V_ that when you press it a little light beep goes off? I think it would be difficult technologically, and then I wonder if it's if it's more just a gimmick then anything else. There might be something that you can do in the circuit board and the chip to make it make a noise or something, but it would take a lot more development than we have this afternoon. we so we do we've decided not to worry about that for now. 'cause well, the designs are very bright, so you're right, they're gonna stick out,
why don't we do a product evaluation using your criteria, I think we're supposed to have one that we do it for. I was a little vague on what exactly I'm supposed to do, I have to like write something on the whiteboard, so. It's kind of like like a joystick kind of thing, It makes look more fruity as well. There it could have a stem like that, is that where people are leaning then, the potato? Variety of colours are nice. I think I'm leaning towards the potato. that's really gotten the simplicity of the buttons down, that one. Potato. some of the things that we've talked about before we need to make sure that that remote actually does conform to the things that we said it was going to. what we sort of wanna do is that we each need to separately rank each of the following things and then I'll tabulate an average and each of you can tell me on a scale of one to seven with one being really extremely true and seven being not true at all, or false, First we wanna know if it meets the fancy look and feel objective. in my opinion the for now at least, the yellow one is probably somewhere in the middle so I'm gonna say it's like a three. I I kind of think it's it's unique enough that I'd give it a one or a two. I dunno if fancy is the word I would use. and same sort of scale for functionality, is it functional? I think it's extremely functional, I think it'll get everything done, then I'm gonna give it a two. is it technologically innovative?. Not really, I mean not so much, 'cause we we don't have the L_C_D_ screen, the kinetic battery. How many people would notice that, though? And if it's made of like latex, that whole idea, that's pretty cool. Think I'm gonna go with the four as well. we next wanna see if it has a spongy quality and if indeed it's made of latex or rubber I
First we wanna know if it meets the fancy look and feel objective. in my opinion the for now at least, the yellow one is probably somewhere in the middle so I'm gonna say it's like a three. I I kind of think it's it's unique enough that I'd give it a one or a two. I dunno if fancy is the word I would use. and same sort of scale for functionality, is it functional?

And if it's made of like latex, that whole idea, that's pretty cool. Think I'm gonna go with the four as well. we next wanna see if it has a spongy quality and if indeed it's made of latex or rubber I it's spongy all the way. Give it a one. and the next is, does it integrate some notion of fruits and vegetables? is it gonna be yellow? We might wanna keep it yellow. I know it would make it a little less c a little more confusing, but if we had all the buttons in black, and a design in and the outside in yellow, that'd be our corporate one and we could also have alternative colours, one a more conservative one, one that's more fruity. and can we have like an R_R_ inscribed on the bottom or something? so I think it's pretty fruity. I think i it's kind of mangoey too. That's a much more trendy than a potato, and does the design match the appropriate behaviour? Remember earlier we discussed that people don't use a lot of buttons, so I'm gonna give it a one. also we talked earlier about R_S_I_ and wanting to prevent any sort of like Carpal Tunnely kind of thing. Do we think that the latex sort of grip appropriately takes that into account? I think I'll give it
we're gonna use a kinetic battery, we want to use a simple chip, we're choosing a latex case w in fruity colours that's curved and we're using push buttons with a supplement of an on-screen menu. we made three different prototypes our colours not are not fixed, we have the on off button at the tip, very visible, very big. We have our up and down buttons, which are also gonna be our channel selectors, and we have our little menu button here. If you push if you're just pushing these normally, they're the menu buttons, if the volume buttons rather. If you press select once, they become channel changing buttons. That's our number one prototype. The little lightning bolt in it, very cute. We call that one the rhombus, this one is known as the potato, It's an ergonomic shape, I've gone here just for just for four buttons on this one. the two blue buttons here are for adjusting the volume. So you've got volume up and volume down on the other side here. this middle button here brings up the on-screen menu Could the middle button of the on-screen menu function as a power button? it would make it hard to turn the machine off, to turn your T_V_ off. And then finally we have the Martian or the pear, either way. it's a bit different, just a little bit more of a creative feel. you have the on off toggle stem on the top. And then you have on the sides to make it a little bit more three-dimensional, plus it's an interesting talking point to have standing up. We figured it could stand up like this on your table, if you wanted it to, if I made the bot the bottom flat. in terms of making decisions, what we'd need to do is first of all decide on a form which of the three different shapes we want, then decide what kind of button layout we want, how many buttons, and then to choose what colours we want to make the buttons normally we'd go for
but the f the feature that we considered for it not getting lost. we were we were talking about that a little bit and we think that each of these are so distinctive, that it it's not just like another piece of technology around your house. It's gonna be somewhere that it can be seen. So we're we're not thinking that it's gonna be as critical to have the loss Would it be very difficult to just have an external device that like I dunno, you tape to your to your T_V_ that when you press it a little light beep goes off? I think it would be difficult technologically, and then I wonder if it's if it's more just a gimmick then anything else. There might be something that you can do in the circuit board and the chip to make it make a noise or something, but it would take a lot more development than we have this afternoon. we so we do we've decided not to worry about that for now. 'cause well, the designs are very bright, so you're right, they're gonna stick out, it was inspired by the potato,
I felt very creative. I think we've been successful I enjoyed making the prototypes. I think we could've done even better with a little bit more information, like what's a single-curved case, but given given what we had I think that we did we did really well. if I'd had more market research on the fruits and vegetables, maybe we could've taken that into account. That was the last one, like I chose not to do a PowerPoint I think we all made very significant contributions, I don't think anybody dominated it, People should really base their remotes on fruits and vegetables. I I am really into the idea of kinetic batteries now after reading about them. Is the project evaluated? Yes.
there's the final questionnaire and meeting summary. this is the great product kids, and that we have a market for it, especially if we can produce it at twelve point three Make sure in your questionnaire to put down criticisms of both the process and the the final results I do like the Martian remote. If we could choose more than one, that would be my second choice. Although the tog toggle I would break it. I would break it. Is it started as a pear, Kind of looks like a penguin, like with no eye. Nothing will come up until after our meeting's supposed to be over,
now we're gonna look at finances. I have an Excel sheet that we're actually gonna calculate the cost, We're using kinetic battery, Simple. Guess it's double-curved. don't we need plastic, and It was rubber and special colour, we're using we're gonna need at least two special colours. I don't know what the se the basic colour is though. like we'll have yellow and black. Maybe the R_R_ will be in colour as well, And how many buttons do we have? We have six. the case material will just have one colour, but then the buttons will be in special colours? Special form? I think they're fine. Material, we want them rubber as well probably, yeah. Thirteen point seven. what can we reduce? let's have our buttons all be one colour. Maybe it's single-curved, It's single curved. case material is rubber and it's a special colour, It was it was thirteen and now it's fifteen. Now it's twelve. What was our target price again? Twelve point five. So we're okay, I think. are the are the costs under twelve fifty Euro? Yes. I thought the pen was a little distracting for me personally,
Let's move on to the project evaluation. Project process. Satisfaction with for example the room for creativity, leadership, teamwork, the means, any new ideas found. So I guess what we're gonna talk about here is just evaluating how we created this project, the information we got on the news, how we used it, if we were able to, you know, use our creativity with the information, how how well I guess I led it, the how well we worked together as a team, the digital pens, the whiteboard. I felt very creative. I think we've been successful I enjoyed making the prototypes. I think we could've done even better with a little bit more information, like what's a single-curved case, but given given what we had I think that we did we did really well. if I'd had more market research on the fruits and vegetables, maybe we could've taken that into account. I thought the pen was a little distracting for me personally, That was the last one, like I chose not to do a PowerPoint I think we all made very significant contributions, I don't think anybody dominated it,. What did we find for new ideas? People should really base their remotes on fruits and vegetables. I I am really into the idea of kinetic batteries now after reading about them. Is the project evaluated? Yes.
we're making a remote control we've got to make something as fashionable as possible, and then finally we'll incorporate as kind of the last stage you know where you guys build or tell me tell us what's possible and then you tell us what we can hope for and what way to go and then ov obviously the U_I_D_ and the I_D_ you know you you can keep on the you know sort of at the cutting edge of how to get about maximising what is possible
I'm gonna put these initial ideas that we've got in the project documents,
for now just for th the white board basically just to get used to it, I'm a excellent Project Manager.. I'm Marty, I'm Sarah, and I'm the Marketing Manager or something. I'm Ron. and I am the User Interface Designer. I'm Nathan,
one of the things I I was gonna mention to you you guys the designers is that it m we probably need a rever it needs to be a universal remote control probably. we can't kind of build it into other products. For instance like a mobile phone or something like that. Maybe a remote with changeable faces, like the faces that you can buy for phones.
one of the things I I was gonna mention to you you guys the designers is that it m we probably need a rever it needs to be a universal remote control probably. we can't kind of build it into other products. For instance like a mobile phone or something like that. Maybe a remote with changeable faces, like the faces that you can buy for phones. does anybody have any initial ideas? as soon as you said that I was thinking like all the other things you could get a remote to do, like your microwave or your front door But I'm thinking I'm thinking kind of P_D_A_ design so touch screen design rather than button so that you can kind of flip around all sorts of different things. maybe like an L_ like a touch screen type of remote? I think, making it out of a nice material would be very important, I think, it wouldn't be such a bad idea to have a like a locator device, maybe a simple button that you have on your television to help you find your remote. Cou could we not do something where like just a little lit like literally just a very small kind of thing that you could place something else and it makes the remote page. so we'll have to be careful of exactly who we're marketing this to,
I'm gonna put these initial ideas that we've got in the project documents,
project finance. what we're trying to do is sell this remote for twenty five Euros.. the profit aims to make fifty million Euros on it. Eur internationally. but we wanna try to make it for twelve fifty.
I need you to tell us what we what the user's gonna want. U_I_D_ well yeah you right g your assignments are up there and I'd like the Industrial Designer to get ge think about what needs to be done, like what the basic function of it.
U_I_D_ well yeah you right g your assignments are up there
and I'd like the Industrial Designer to get ge think about what needs to be done, like what the basic function of it.
I need you to tell us what we what the user's gonna want.
we've got y the Industrial Designer suggests or pretty much emphatically suggested that we need to go with plastic. think we're constrained to plastics based on what sh on what you guys have all said to me let's go for a plastic built or b plastic cased
it'll have your your carrier provider name come up first like while it's loading I'm wondering how we're gonna get we put fashion into electronics onto this device. Comes on every time you turn it on and then that's it it seems like it would suffice to have just the R_R_ on there.
Gotta wonder though, if we're adding so much technology to this one remote, are we still gonna be able to meet out twelve pou our twelve fifty Euro you know goal for selling these things. It seems like, we're not gonna be able to handle all these functions with just one microchip. I guess we'll cross that bridge in a la slightly later stages of development we'd have to maybe sacrifice the face plates for a touch screen? But then again that costs as well.
I'm gonna save th a copy of this in case you guys need any reminders. and the minutes that I'll do it in a second and put them in the shared folder for later reference. I've put my files in the shared folder as well.
I think we've covered most of these important questions through this through you guys's presentations we've got y the Industrial Designer suggests or pretty much emphatically suggested that we need to go with plastic. Sarah, she's recommended that we go for simpler functions, so fewer functions but we need to decide who are we selling this to, you s your stats suggested that seventy five percent of people under thirty five wanted, thought about voice control, so do we wanna go for that, or do we want to go for an older demographic, if we're gonna go for a sleek look I mean we are putting the fashion in electronics. We're not catering to the pensioners of the world I don't think so. So maybe this we should look into this younger demographic. we need to wonder h about how we make it better and smaller and faster think we're constrained to plastics we've got this idea, Ron was saying we need to think about revolutionising the way it's looking, this voice operation thing is I think is a good idea assuming that it's doable, at least for the basic controls, you can't say record alias tonight at seven P_M_ but we might be able to say volume up. I think it would be possible to combine the locator device and the voice recognition technology. With a simple command like locate. And then it could start to beep The difficulty wh would be in I think like i you couldn't speak into the remote that you're trying to find. but then again you have this wee this wee thing you know that's just a little chip or whatever that has the page button, maybe that could be voice activated too. A little sticky pad to stick on top of your television. but yeah I like that, I like that, the voice recognition for the paging system. The other thing is we might be able to handle the simplicity of a remote control and kind of put the more complicated things into a voice control. So it could be sold to both
I was looking through some marketing reports that we've got and we had a usability test where we were actually sort like watching a hundred people use T_V_ remotes and see what it is that they're using and then they filled out a questionnaire about what they like and what they don't about their general T_V_ remote control practices. pretty much through testing we were finding out that most of the time, everybody's used to using changing the channel, turning it on, using the volume, the majority of the time that's all that's going on, for some people they're important, the other functions happen, but the primary uses are really really basic. and so big complicated remotes like one we saw in the last presentation are really not the general public's use, they even find it frustrating when there are all those buttons that they don't know what to do with. And we also found out that fifty percent of our people, their the worst thing about a remote is how often they lose it. And then they can't find it in the room. So I think what we were talking about with a pager or something, will really come into play with a lot of these people. there's also a survey about what they liked about remotes, and pretty much they all think they're hideous and not very useful, and the younger demographics are all really interested in voice recognition options. I don't know if that's something we're ready to look into technically, but it is s something worth thinking about, especially since the younger demographic's obviously the one that's gonna keep growing, but basically it really is the primary functions and getting it to look nice, which are
if next we can have the User Interface Developer go ahead and make a brief presentation that'd be great as well. Here we have a my technical functions design presentation. we n basically need to operate an electronic device, it needs to be universal and possibly operate several different types of devices although we now find that that that's no problem. basically wanna send messages to a television set. that would be any number of different things such as switch on the television, switch to the next channel, that sort of thing, some of the other things I found is a a complicated remote control sorry that we can't quite see my red there very well but this remote control has many functions but it it is quite complicated and most users will find it find that they won't use most of the functions because they don't know how to use them and don't wanna take the time to learn how to do it.. Another remote control, slightly different, it's a simpler remote control many less buttons but has many fewer functions, m much easier for the user to manipulate and use. it also has a bit of a cheap look and it's also quite boring. my personal preferences. Revolutionise the idea of a remote control. so attain the functionality of a complicated device but use a simple formatted display for the user to to work with.. Just incorporating some of the ideas that we had previously like having multiple face
I'm gonna turn over to the Industrial Designer to go ahead and make a presentation We're gonna have to understand how remote controls work and res successfully complete this project. remote control works as follows. sends message to another system, there's an energy source involved in that like a battery or solar power, something along those lines, there's an integrated circuit, which is the microchip, and usually the way a a remote control works is it sends infrared bits to another system. A user interface controls the chip, basically that's the casing and the buttons and accordingly the messages as well. and I found that too much metal in remote design could potentially cause interference with the ability of the remote to send commands. And too much metal can cause remotes to behave unexpectedly by receiving false signals. too much metal is used sometimes and there's also the possibility of the remote catching on fire just think of those lawsuits, that'd be really bad. Therefore I suggest primarily plastic construction., components. Just some ideas that I had,, energy source, it's kinda hip to be eco friendly so I thought maybe we could do something with solar power with an alkaline battery backup. the user interface, since we can't use metal I was thinking maybe a high grade recycled plastic. The chip,, silicon based chip I don't really see any way around that,, the sender well I'm thinking infrared 'cause it is the industry standard, PAL and N_T_S_C_ compatible and probably a two hundred foot range. personal preferences, I really think that we should use plastic as opposed to metal, which adm admittedly is gonna come at the cost of a certain aesthetic value, Is is there a way that we can use modern types of polymers, or mo modern types of plastics that maybe do have some kind of aesthetic value on the lapt on these laptops and other ones they use a a pretty nice, Yeah that shouldn't be a problem.
I'm just gonna go over real quickly some news I've just got from the board on how we're supposed to do with this remote control. And then I'm gonna turn over to you guys to make brief presentations on what you've found and then we'll have a bit of discussion. what I've just found out from the board but it needs to be television only. we're not doing D_V_D_, it also needs to have the company colours included in it. that's red and black. And it has to have the slogan, case you guys forget the slogan it's, we put fashion in electronics. and no teletext. I'm not sure what teletext is so we don't wanna include that in this particular design. For reasons that I don't really know. but it's the board so there you go. given those guidelines which will have some effect on how we design we'll discuss it later
have we confirmed that we're gonna go ahead with a touch screen Yeah I think that would be best. With a touch screen for the basic functions.
So maybe this we should look into this younger demographic. I'm seeing that we're gonna just basically focus on this young demographic group, aim it at them,
I think it would be possible to combine the locator device and the voice recognition technology. With a simple command like locate. And then it could start to beep but then again you have this wee this wee thing you know that's just a little chip or whatever that has the page button, maybe that could be voice activated too. A little sticky pad to stick on top of your television. Even if you can't do voice recognition for the paging you know just some kind of simple button that's just a I guess another infrared signal to the remote control to emit some kind of paging. Just a beep.
And the the material like the plastics and so forth, we were discussing that being using like a rubber kind of softer feel, if you feel the the tip on this pen it's a bit gives just a bit. something where it's a a more advanced f form of plastic that has some kind of a tactile response to it. Just kind of the squishy feel. let's see if we can do a squishy non-remote control-looking remote control.
Based on what Nathan presented as far as the various costs and benefits I think, I dunno, what do you guys think about the touch screen at this point? I think it's our most marketable feature But can we really afford it My estimate is that in order to incorporate touch screen technology it's gonna cost us upwards of seventeen fifty Euro per remote, that's just an estimate though. it's just, it is a question of and how much ca o does that mean we're gonna have to increase the price to make money. Where do you guys come up with these numbers? That's just off the top of my head, I mean if you're gonna pay for an expensive high class remote, you're gonna expect it to do something we could probably maybe shrink the profit margins rather than selling for twenty five, sell 'em for thirty, but that's something that we can have finance deal with., I say that we provisionally go with the touch screen and we can look into this other manufacturing option, and maybe we can get 'em somewhere else cheaper. let's let's say that okay so the touch screen will be our our main selling point here. I mean I think that we really have two main selling points, 'cause with voice recognition I think that our casing and the voice recognition I mean, if if we're looking at bottom line, now we're looking at upping the cost to seventeen to get the touch screen on, I think we might have to drop the voice rec. I think we'd have to decide between 'em definitely. To be honest, we have the capa we have the design in-house, I mean we've we've come up with this, with this new voice What do you think on it Nathan? About the voice rec? I think if we we do both the obviously production costs are going to go way up I mean we we have to r reflect back on what our market research did say. and they said they wanted voice recognition. Course, maybe they hadn't thought
Now we kind of have to come to some decisions, and all three of us can have a chat about it..
If we're really not handling the remote control to a great extent we could possibly get away from the idea of having a hand-held remote control and maybe kind of have a round remote control that kind of looks like a paperweight or something like that, kind of a sleek little neat thing that sits on your table or something. Why, why moving away from hand-held, why? if you don't need to pick it up it could kind of be a selling point. if it's got voice recognition it can be technically anywhere in your room and still do its job. Do you think people that are people that buy a remote, are they always gonna wanna use the voice recognition I think we're banking on selling it to more than just voice recognition people, like we want it to work fundamentally as a basic manual too, we have to have buttons on it too as well. I mean, why not have a little rounded kind of thing, it could still have the basic buttons on it. And maybe a menu button and so forth, use a channel button to scroll through the menu d if they want to record programmes or whatever because we need to escape the traditional shape of a remote. I'm thinking of the airport portal, you know like that little pod looking thing? I'm recalling that she mentioned that we n need to get away from the surgical white kind of brushed aluminium thing but you could have a very tasteful wood coloured or earth tone kind of Terracotta bowl or something.
You discussed either a lithium or a solar power. Would the solar power be enough to fuel a voice recognition?, the solar power definitely would be but I think just to keep people from getting annoyed, we should install a small backup battery. we can't guarantee sunlight everywhere it works about the same as a solar powered calculator, and you know how those those don't really require that much light, I'm willing to agree with everything that's been said.
, basically I was looking at what's going on in the remote control market right now and what's going on in other design fields, to see sort of what's what's trendy, what's new, what's happening., remote control right now basically everybody says they want newer, fancier, more exciting that we need innovative design options and there needs to be an easy user interface. the challenge is that current trends right now, across the board in fashion, in furniture, in technology, is a very organic fruit and vegetable kind of thing. Now I'm not saying we should have, you know, tomato shaped remote controls or anything, but I think it is possible maybe to use natural colours, like if wood is an option, that whole organic, sleek, clean, Different skin options, and th apparently the feel of the next couple of years is spongy, though if we can get around to getting piloting, I thought maybe a casing option like not like a skin, but like a holder almost if you could do like, leather options or wood options or something As far as the rubber that we can use we can use a rubber as part of the case, it has a consistency of those stress balls. I think perhaps the double curve thing and maybe this rubber option is our best way to go for right now. but then if the touch screen thing isn't gonna work out for us that's really a non-issue.
basically what I'm gonna have to talk to you about today is component design and it's been brought to my attention that we may be somewhat limited as to what we can do Basically what I'm gonna be doing is talking to you about that., components of a remote control, okay. We've already kind of gone over this but we're gonna have to get into more detail Energy source,, our manufacturer offers a variety of energy sources, your standard battery, solar cells. Our manufacturer didn't say anything about lithium if we do go that route, we might have to look elsewhere., and also there's a kinetic energy possibility. Basically, it's like a the idea of moving the remote would create enough energy to keep it running. but I don't know whether that would be powerful enough to illuminate a touch screen., the case, we have a few options, plastic, rubber or wood. and then as far as the way it's shaped, we can do standard boring flat, which we probably don't wanna do, curved or very sexy double curved. What kind of th thickness are we looking at?, I imagine that we could specify., the buttons, there are multiple scroll buttons available from our manufacturer, but to use those we'd have to use more chips, And if we do go with the rubber doubled curved case we'll have to use rubber push buttons because the other buttons aren't compatible with that. touch screen equals many chips which equals many Euro., one thing that I noticed was that most remotes operate on a infrare on the infrared part of the spectrum. So you notice when you push a button on a remote you can't see anything coming out of it but in fact there is light coming out of the remote one thing that I thought might be interesting was to use part use visible light coming out of the remote, just kind of as a fun gimmick. So you could actually see something coming out of the remote when you pushed it. is there an option that we can have that
interface concept by your faithful user interface designer. So yur user interface, guys, is basically aspects of a computer system that we can see or hear, or otherwise perceive., commands and mechanisms, that basically user uses to control the operator operating system. Here's a d series of different remote controls that are out on the market today. the following are a bunch of different interface concepts. voice recognition, we we actually have some new information from our research design team current voice recognition starts up to about eighty speech samples, and basically you record your own verbal labels c and connect them to the remote control. our design team, research team, has been able to set up a system in which you can teach the remote control voice c recognition system to respond to with standard responses. Like you could say good morning remote control and it'll say in a sexy female voice, Good morning Joe.., another concept is what Apple has come up with, the spinning wheel with L_C_ display like on the iPod and then we have the scroll button with integrated push-button, kind of like a modern a bit bulky, a bit crazy, I don't think that's we're necessarily going for. And some special components, ideas like blocking, having the ability to block channels from your for your children and dedicated buttons for for commonly used channels and even ideas like secured or hidden programming but I again if we go with touch screen I don't think that's a big issue. and this is kind of the the big daddy of remote controls here. the jumbo universal remote control is almost impossible to misplace or lose. so I I mean my ideas here and kind of where I think we're heading is something slightly larger than a regular iPod with a hard cla c plastic casing changeable casings our design team was possibly talking about including one extra face plate with the package touch screen interface, possibly having go-to buttons being stuck into the system so those don't move away from the screen,, the important ones like power
, the solar power definitely would be but I think just to keep people from getting annoyed, we should install a small backup battery.
like if wood is an option, that whole organic, sleek, clean, Different skin options, though if we can get around to getting piloting, I thought maybe a casing option like not like a skin, but like a holder almost if you could do like, leather options or wood options or something As far as the rubber that we can use we can use a rubber as part of the case, it has a consistency of those stress balls. I think perhaps the double curve thing and maybe this rubber option is our best way to go for right now. I like the idea of of rubber too I think that goes against the whole fancy something, a new line,
That's just off the top of my head, Where do you guys come up with these numbers?, this is just off the top of my head keep in mind, Sorry about the lack of information on cost, I just haven't been provided that information by our manufacturers
touch screen equals many chips which equals many Euro. But can we really afford it My estimate is that in order to incorporate touch screen technology it's gonna cost us upwards of seventeen fifty Euro per remote, that's just an estimate though. it's just, it is a question of and how much ca o does that mean we're gonna have to increase the price to make money. Where do you guys come up with these numbers? That's just off the top of my head,, I say that we provisionally go with the touch screen I mean, if if we're looking at bottom line, now we're looking at upping the cost to seventeen to get the touch screen on, I think we might have to drop the voice rec. I think we'd have to decide between 'em definitely. I think if we we do both the obviously production costs are going to go way up Does having both really up our costs? I can't see how it wouldn't, so we have to pick between one of the two.. we already have research backing voice recognition as you know fiscally solvent., this is just off the top of my head keep in mind,
although I'm not saying we should completely rule out major functions, they should be secondary, at least if not functionally then visually, Like maybe have menu things. If, if we're not going the touch-screen route then we can just incorporate maybe something that folds out and something that slides down to reveal the you know more complicated things. we could do a slide or a compartment, Or you know, a b a b a a series of you know three or four buttons with a menu button and then a side an s up and down type of thing, like on like on a D_V_D_ player. we need to figure out what kind of buttons we're going to use, are we going to use scroll buttons? Rubber buttons? it seems to me that we could just do the stick with the rubber 'cause since we're probably gonna be using some kind of rubber for the outside case I think to a certain extent we have to stick with kind of a little bit traditional in terms of the buttons have we decided that we are gonna go with different style cases for different people? because you have different cases and that might open up your market a little bit obviously, but obviously having more cases also costs more you could have a, you know, a kind of a natural wood colour, like a stained wood and, I don't know, olive green or something. That wouldn't be so much of a problem to incorporate into the colour of the thing. let's work on multiple case colours.
Nathan, I'd like you to work on just the basic look and feel,, what are our broad constraints before we deve design a prototype.
I need you guys to work together on making a prototype, using prototype building materials.
, and if you can check product evaluation with m some pilots and stuff.
And Ron if you can figure out how probably best to lay out this idea of this simple design with the voice recognition built in and also this kind of drop down or s on the side kind of menu options simple.
let's work on multiple case colours.
We will omit the touch screen in favour of voice recognition.
And the the material like the plastics and so forth, we were discussing that being using like a rubber kind of softer feel, Just kind of the squishy feel.
If we're really not handling the remote control to a great extent we could possibly get away from the idea of having a hand-held remote control and maybe kind of have a round remote control if it's got voice recognition it can be technically anywhere in your room and still do its job. stick with the same kind of kinda yeah, the same basic non-remote kind of remote design.
I got this slide from the coach this one's a bit unclear to me to be perfectly fair,. so I guess we are going to discuss our project process and I'm not sure what it's connected to. I guess this is the point where we go out of role it looks like and talk about our satisfaction for room for creativity and so forth and how that all worked, I guess,. As in within the team or? I think so yeah. Are we considering these points here? I think they're starting blocks I think in general, for a day's worth of work we actually were relatively productive, considering the little amount of input we had going in., and the technology has definitely been a help, it's really been interesting to try out all this new stuff. We didn't use the whiteboard at all. No, no whiteboard. and I feel like if you guys had been designing in here perhaps that would have changed but because of room constraints, doesn't really matter., also had I not been intrigued about the pen, I don't think I woulda used it at all, I didn't write barely anything. Was pretty cool tack though. I am disappointed I didn't get a note back from my personal coach. Attempts to contact coach ineffective. n I think there was a lot of room for creativity, we could do whatever basically what we wanted until the budget came down on us,. And even then we did get a decent product turned out although it's not everything we wanted it to be. I think, yeah re I thought it was like really creative actually, I mean. I think the teamwork was good as well. My one my one criticism is that we didn't have enough colours to work with, You could have developed multiple skins really had you had more colours. What did you guys think about the the the roles? I think it was pretty clever 'cause we were never able to get too far off track because the information came in at the right time and kind of
we could do whatever basically what we wanted until the budget came down on us,.
I guess now we just go to the project evaluation basically I was just evaluating from what we know of how our product's working right now with the criteria that we set at the beginning of these are the things we needed to do, these are the things that look like we feel they're important. so I was looking at basic design things, are technologies up to where we hoped they would be Is the design what we wanted it to do? and does it fulfil the aesthetic qualities that our original market research was looking for?. Does it respond to voice recognition?, the only thing is with with the pull-out panel, that is, can it take some adjusting And overall, in general, it looks like it's coming up to par. but then, once you get used to it, it does make a lot of sense. So I think overall we're headed in the right direction. They like that spongy feel. I think eventually if we do branch out with this product maybe we do have a higher budget options and if it goes over with this model we can look into wider range voice recognition like from other rooms of the house and stuff, I am bit disappointed about losing the solar panel
Though I did feel like th the level of information dropped off severely over the course of the day. but I didn't actually get any information for the last presentation at all. Nothing, I didn't even get an email, I feel like that was slightly lacking when I was reporting about what each of us was doing I was often confused as to what you were doing and then I also felt like you know a lot of our discussion would centre around n specifically what my task was and then in the end I think our jobs kind of melded together a little bit more,
but we just went for a classic rubber button
, what we need to discuss now is the finance of it, you provided a number that actually sounds quite nice. the trouble is I was just given this by finance., it's a spreadsheet of the parts and I've just tentatively put in what it's going to look like. if we can just itemize what's in here, it's a solar cell thing With a back-up battery? The voice recognition area actually doubles as as the solar cell area. Yeah. It's a s a speaker and a sensor at the same time and the case, it's more of a single-curved case, and we've got a rubber skin material basically throughout.. Push button interface with this other drop-down so maybe we've got two push button interfaces And s I guess you have to mark special colour and special form as well, 'Cause it i it is very unconventional, M come in at sixteen? a bit over budget,. what we could do perhaps, a simple fix would maybe to switch away from the solar cells or take out the back-up battery. I think that if we're talking about it being one of our main selling features, being environmental and without the batteries and what not, I mean we could take we could take the battery out of it you see but you're gonna have to set up a call centre for that one per cent of the time and saying oh look my remote isn't working I think in the long-run it's better to keep the battery, I mean obviously the solar cell is a big piece of the way we're marketing this as like a natural, new thing, but honestly if we cut that one piece out we're actually coming in under budget I mean you might be able to sway me on the idea that we our main selling point could be already this voice recognition thing I mean that's what sets us apart perhaps when the cell technology comes down in price we can bring that back into the game And the reality is you know, for me from an ideological
we have assembled our prototype,., we took into account a lot of the things that we went over in the last meeting,. Some of the most important things to consider are that we decided not to go for the touch screen and opted for some very large buttons for the primary functions,. This is going to be the on off button and we have these buttons to go through the channels and then two volume buttons down here, d we decided those were the most important buttons. And then, for the more advanced functions there is a slide out panel here and you can see that there are lots of other things going on. and provides a very nice aesthetic when it's all put away,. As far as the whole visible light thing, we decided to go with the multiple colours coming out, Of course, if that's annoying for some people that function can be turned off.. we talked a quite a bit about you know the the interchangeable faces and what we've done here is come up with a bit of a natural look here f we call it fruity of course that's interchangeable and I think it would be desirable for the for the regular product in the in the in the in the first packaging to be something a little bit more subdued but this is kind of something that can be done and as you can see on the television there we have the voice detector device on the top there.. So that that will work quite well with with regard to finding this contraption. if you give it a touch it does have actually a bit of a spongy feel, clearly there's gonna be some more colours and what not available. I worried about the materials, the entire thing is covered in a rubber coating it's not gonna break like some types of plastic that's dropped. and if you touch it it does have that nice squishy feel. I dunno if you noticed, but I wrote the the company's name on the telephone screen,, but I
As far as the whole visible light thing, we decided to go with the multiple colours coming out,
what we could do perhaps, a simple fix would maybe to switch away from the solar cells but honestly if we cut that one piece out we're actually coming in under budget and maybe move ahead with the project, without the solar cell. I think unfortunately that's our best option.
I'm supposed to do this final report thing at the end so I'll put all that into the final report as well, or as much as seems like
we've established that the costs weren't really within budget, We did the project evaluation based on Sarah's evaluation of on off switches though it was really technically an evaluation of the product, not the project in general. And it's all recorded, I'm supposed to do this final report thing at the end so I'll put all that into the final report as well, or as much as seems like I will save this into the project documents. You guys ready to celebrate? that's our last step. Celebration. I guess we can probably call that meeting to an end for the most part. I guess we'll call that a a doner. that's the end of the meeting.
here we have our detailed design meeting where we will look at the prototype I finally figured out what this whole second bullet point is about in my It means I'm supposed to read the minutes from the previous meeting. just real briefly to go over minutes from last meeting, basically the moral of the story from our last minute last meeting was that we that we had meetings from we had presentations done by the Industrial Designer, or from Nathan, and Ron and from Sarah about what we can do here and we essentially came to the conclusion that we should develop a remote with voice recognition, I_E_ that had a vaguely non-remote like shape because you didn't really need to use it as a remote since you could just use your voice. That would include some mostly just the simple design features for a television operation but with a slide or a fold-out bay for more advanced functions for users. the U_I_D_ and the I_D_ were asked to go ahead and start developing a prototype for us to look at.
And U_I_D_, the technical fun functions design,
It needs to be compatible 'cause universal remote controls are never universal. and another thing that I think is important is the d the design of the product, how it feels in your hand. They want the ergonomic ones. If it's just flat and kind of boring th those don't Nobody wants to buy those any more. What kinda battery would we want to use? Double A_. So double or triple? it's okay, we don't have to decide about it now,
And the marketing person, that's Courtney, is going to do the user requirements specification.
you're going to think about the working design.
First we're gonna start off by using our tools. I think we should forgo the whiteboard since we can't actually see what we're writing. right now so we're all gonna draw our favourite animal and then sum up our favourite characteristics of that animal.
Hi everybody and welcome to our kick-off meeting for our new product that we're gonna be designing. I'm Mandy and I'm the Project Manager. And I know all your names again, Courtney, Fenella and Amber. Okay, here is our agenda for this meeting. tool training, we're going to, I guess, figure out what to do on this project with our individual roles. we're gonna make a project plan and then have some time for discussion and close up the meeting. We're gonna make a new remote control that's original, trendy and also user-friendly. We're gonna have discuss the functional design first, how is it gonna be used, what's the actual goal here, it has to operate T_V_, blah blah blah. And we're going to do individual work on that and then meet. Same thing with conceptual design. And then the detailed design, just more in-depth, get the actual schematics of the remote.
here are some topics that we might be able to discuss. Expe our experiences with remote controls, our first ideas about this new remote, anything that you can bring to the table for this project. Well, we wanna make a multifunctional remote,
the selling price for our remote is going to be twenty-five Euro, and our profit aim is fifty million Euro. We're going to make this an international product marketed in the States, in Europe, in Asia. And our production cost to make that profit is gonna be a max of twelve fifty Euro per remote.
The I_D_ is going to work on the components concept,
U_I_D_ the user interface concept,
And don't forget we need to include the colour of our company and the logo.
and the speech recognition could be part of the lost and found device, too. we we need a like homing device.
The I_D_ is going to work on the components concept, U_I_D_ the user interface concept, and you're going to do some trend watching.
but the other bulb, I think, is good to just to indicate, I'm doing something, it's sort of like a reassurance. Like that we know the battery's working.
Well, should it be larger buttons in general, I think we should do something like maybe bigger and round like bubbles.
and you're going to do some trend watching.
We need a power source, we're gonna need a smart chip if we're gonna make it multi-functional.
'Kay. I didn't get a chance to complete this one, 'cause some of the tools that I was given were frustrating. extra functions will probably need an additional chip. power source, I figured, batteries, Typically a remote has either two double A_s or four triple A_s, sometimes three. so a large on-off button would probably be good.
So no D_V_D_, no TiVo, no stereo. So we've simplified, we don't need all those play, fast-forward, rewind, or no menu buttons. So we've pretty much pared it down to on-off, volume, mute, channel up and down, the numbers So we just have it like add a menu button then for the various things needed,
extra bulb could just be for flashiness, but the other bulb, I think, is good to just to indicate, I'm doing something, it's sort of like a reassurance. Like that we know the battery's working.
Now we have Courtney with the functional requirements. okay so we tested a hundred subjects in our lab, and we just we watched them and we also made them fill out a questionnaire, Seventy five percent think they're ugly. Eighty percent want they've are willing to spend more, which is good news for us if we make it look fancier, And we need we need it to be simple, yet it needs to be high-tech looking. So What do you mean by the current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user, like they have to press the buttons. I I think it's like the engineering versus user, And so people say that they typically lose it, and R_S_I_, I'm not very sure what that is. Do we really need t to provide more information on what R_S_I_ is? yeah, that's what my web site said, I think that we should go with something that's more user-friendly. And also we found our team found that speech recognition is it's like an up-and-coming thing Didn't they didn't our rival companies manufacture a remote that you would press the button on the T_V_ and it would the remote would beep so if you have lost it We could definitely include that if we wanted to.
Would it just be universal for everyone, you think? Because I think even if something has large buttons, as long as they are not childishly large, like even technically non-technically challenged people are gonna use it.
and users don't really need all of the buttons that are contained on there, because they only use ten percent of the buttons really.
we we need a like homing device. And on the charger, just like a phone, like you get a portable phone and it's got a charger, and if you d leave your phone somewhere, you push the button to find it, and it finds th the phone beeps for you. Well, if you have the base, you could start putting in a charger and then you have a different kind of battery. Rechargeable batteries are cheaper usually. If we have the speech recognition then we can start aiming at a like another kind of more handicapped disabled demo demographic. It's really the people twenty five to thirty five. and the speech recognition could be part of the lost and found device, too.
And don't forget we need to include the colour of our company and the logo. We could just have the logo in yellow, or maybe a yellow light for the keys. If you have this sort of strip kind of down at the bottom the base of it, just like yellow with the R_R_. Well, do we wanna include the numbers like zero through nine? Well, we definitely need those. So we've simplified, we don't need all those play, fast-forward, rewind, or no menu buttons. So we've pretty much pared it down to on-off, volume, mute, channel up and down, the numbers Yeah, audi audio settings and screen settings, we need those or do we just want that accessed accessed from the television itself? I think that that's fine just for the T_V_. you could just double up with like the channel or the volume buttons.
New product requirements. First it's only going to be a T_V_ remote. so we need to somehow include our colour and our company slogan on the remote. But it's becoming out-dated now, because of the Internet. Nobody needs to go to the teletext channel to check the news, So no D_V_D_, no TiVo, no stereo.
Would it just be universal for everyone, you think? Because I think even if something has large buttons, as long as they are not childishly large, like even technically non-technically challenged people are gonna use it. so we're going to go anywhere from kids to adult in the age range
the function of a remote control, as what we've been informed, is basically to send messages to the television set, for example, switch it on, switch it off, go to this channel, go to channel nine, turn the volume up, etcetera. whether that means like we can go and decide the brightness of the screen, things like that, all the more complicated functions of menus. And we can decide if that's what we want,, if we want to include that on the remote, if that's something that would stay on the T_V_ itself, for example. These are two examples. and you can see on the left, it's got a lot more buttons, And then on the right, it's a lot more simpler, And then lastly, it's just the questions that we want to consider like what functions do we want it to include, and how simple, complex it should be?
because we could produce, you know how cellphones have those overlays that you can change the colour. since we're going with batteries instead of solar power, I'd recommend maybe a soft like latex, we could do f a cherry cover for this year So we could do like a b a hard base plastic, and then we could give two latex covers to start.
I think if we had a a locating device with the small one, I think that seems way more advanced.
Okay, so trend watching. fifty eight per cent of the decision of what it should look like, fancy versus functional, and then it has to also be technologically innovative, and yet easy to use. So the customer basically is confused. and also the spongy feel is in in contrast to last year. we need easy to read like large buttons, clearly labelled
I think we should just do the recognition for when it's lost, you know. because people could just be talking and we don't want it going off all the time.
So in Milan and Paris recently the trends have been showing that clothing, shoes and furniture are basically just covered with fruits and vegetable patterns.. But as for the fruits and vegetable patterns, I don't know if we really want to go with that,
so I was thinking maybe instead of doing that what we could do is leave a space for where the logo should be. Like a little cut-out kind of and then if v we do have them illuminate upon contact, they could illuminate yellow.
looking at the interface concept, it's gonna be mostly examples of possibilities of where we can go with this. can't really see, but there's two possible ways, on the r left, if you see on th on the sides of of the remote, you have the sort of scroll down, And then on the right, we have what's really big trend right now, it's the iPod. and it's sort of like you have the both kind of trendy and hip, but also very sleek and and very simple, but technologically advanced. there's the idea of like being able to do it by feel as well as by by sight. for example you have a specific triangular shape that you know you're looking at the up and down arrow. this is particularly geared towards children. and you have the shapes and it's very simplistic and friendly looking. and then down at the bottom you have the logos and that's where you could put the R_R_, Real Reaction. But it's sort of like just taking aspects out of that and saying, well out of this one we like, you know the round section of, b or we'd like the the button size on this.
So basic remote operation runs as follows, we need rubber for buttons, aluminium for battery y contacts, integrated circuit which consists of a diode, transistor, resonator, resistors, and a capacitator, contact discs for the buttons, plastic for the casing, and a power-source, whatever power-source we've actually determined we want. They suggested power options, solar cells, hand dynamo, and kinetic power, I'm not sure how the hand dynamo works, We can offer options for casing such as straight, curved, double-curved, you know, very specific to the customer. certain restrictions do apply here though. And so you functions what for the buttons, scrolling function could be very beneficial to us instead of actual buttons themselves. the manufacturing division also has said that they have several types of chips and they've just developed a sample sensor or sample speaker chip, which we could utilise. push button requires a simple chip and scroll requires more complicated chip.
Let me just add one more thing that I couldn't say before, and that's just that there's the new technology that they've developed on the voice recognition. there's a sample sensor and there's a sample speaker unit for So, you would say like, good morning, coffeemaker, and it would respond, good morning, Jill, I'm not sure exactly how it's gonna work, 'cause do you programme do we program the responses and the questions. I feel like voice recognition would be, I don't know, w it would be too hard to really
I feel like voice recognition would be, I don't know, w it would be too hard to really If it's within our price to get that kind of chip that would, you know, technology But, I guess, we have to look at w what our production cost is for the chip itself anyway. let's let's see if we can decide what kind of energy source we want to have first and foremost.. It's not gonna be a huge universal remote. 'cause it still fits in your hand, so you still wanted something that's comfortable and substantial, but not necessarily full of buttons. If we do a voice-activated locator, though, we're gonna be looking at a more substantial chip. Okay, so what kind of material do we want to be made out of? I don't think wood is a viable option. 'Cause I was thinking if we wanted to get the high in market then you could produce a few in titanium, I I think we should just focus on one design and one concept right now.I'm not sure that we'll have the time and money to produce a whole array of Are we gonna go with the voice activated and what size batteries, double A_, triple A_? or we could do one small lithium, I ki I kind of like your idea about the retro phone dial, 'cause if you have the circle and the button in the middle, then is it gonna get wider than your your hands are, because w And then would the buttons be too small if it was enough to fit on it? which I think if we make it curved like a hand like a hand-shape like if we put the the scroll-button on the side, Well, the other option is in instead of a scroll you just have the buttons up on the side which are on the side. Well I sort of like having the a yellow strip at the bottom with the R_R_ like that. I think maybe we should do it on a b button itself though, or if we're going
Honestly, I think the customer would be kind of irritated by the fact that it has a base I think if we had a a locating device with the small one, I think that seems way more advanced.
I think we should just do the recognition for when it's lost, you know. because people could just be talking and we don't want it going off all the time.
since we're going with batteries instead of solar power, I'd recommend maybe a soft like latex, because we could produce, you know how cellphones have those overlays that you can change the colour. we could do f a cherry cover for this year So we could do like a b a hard base plastic, and then we could give two latex covers to start.
'Kay. And you're gonna do some product evaluation.
the U_I_D_ the user interface design. The I_D_ is going to do the look and feel design, Okay, and right now, the I_D_ and U_I_D_, you two are going to work together on a prototype using modelling clay. I think you're going to get a lot of, I mean, the final say on what buttons get put
'Kay. And you're gonna do some product evaluation.
I I think we should just focus on one design and one concept right now.I'm not sure that we'll have the time and money to produce a whole array of

The I_D_ is going to do the look and feel design, the U_I_D_ the user interface design. Okay, and right now, the I_D_ and U_I_D_, you two are going to work together on a prototype using modelling clay. I think you're going to get a lot of, I mean, the final say on what buttons get put
I don't really know exactly what we should talk about. Feel good meaning what? Physically, Yeah, it was a little difficult to incorporate the cover with the cherry fruit on it. Okay so, we're using the criteria for a seven point scale, do we feel it's very easy to use? Two. That's what I say. Okay, fashionable? I mean like no, I think it's very fashionable. I'll give it a two, because at the moment it's not looking that way. I don't think it's that fashionable. does it feel good? And it's i it is very ergonomically designed. Alright, average is two. Is it technologically innovative? does it have voice I mean the phrase recognition on it? We could do it with the chip, yes. And there's no way you can represent it on here. Y so I'd probably give it a three. But it is just a T_V_ remote. It's just trendy, basically. It's capable of being squishy and fruity.
So our re model slightly resembling a giant delicious cookie appears to be a winner,
let's have the prototype presentation. The base is gonna be gunmetal gray, which is what we had decided, and it's gonna be plastic. then there's the latex cover, which is what you see as red. and the buttons will be a l much lighter blue, almost see-through. The whole thing lights up if you press any button, rather than it just that one button will light up. and then at the bottom we have our logo. And then on the side you have the buttons. and as you've noticed on our prototype they've ended up with a curvature kind of, I think you did an awesome job.
this is where we need to make a final call on if it's a lithium or do we wanna go triple A_s, Oh, let's just go for a lithium.
. Well, we're under cost then. We've got eleven point two. So we can go to production.
We think we got stifled for cri creativity by the company itself, in restricting us only to using a T_V_ remote, initially. We didn't have a whiteboard. And no internet. but my one issue is just like the whole it's for T_V_ only. I was like who's gonna buy a remote just for the T_V_ unless they've lost theirs.
We didn't have a whiteboard.
We think we got stifled for cri creativity by the company itself, in restricting us only to using a T_V_ remote, initially. but my one issue is just like the whole it's for T_V_ only. I was like who's gonna buy a remote just for the T_V_ unless they've lost theirs.
and now we're gonna complete the final questionnaire and meeting summary,
Now we're gonna talk about the project process Yeah, digital pens. I really appreciated those, yeah. The use of the laptops for receiving everything.
Oh, overall I mean I thought we did a good job like minus it being just merely a T_V_ remote we got to choose what we wanted to do with it. and we've all been a pretty congenial team here, I think.
Okay, so now we're moving on to finance, it's not hand dynamo, it's powered by battery, so we give it a Do I just put quantity being one battery, or And special colour. We're really having just push-button interface. button supplements the buttons are no they're they're a special form, 'cause they're indented.. Well, we're under cost then. We've got eleven point two. So we can go to production.
and now we're gonna complete the final questionnaire and meeting summary,
Do I just put quantity being one battery, or this is where we need to make a final call on if it's a lithium or do we wanna go triple A_s, Oh, let's just go for a lithium.
And no internet.
I think we've got a good idea now. Needs to be k wrapped up fairly quickly. we've got thirty minutes to start looking at the at the design in more detail. then we'll we will reconvene in in thirty minutes and try to get some of these ideas more formalised.
and w we need to keep in mind here that the we want to sell this for for twenty five Euro,
we want to m make an overall profit for the the company of fifty million Euros
and w we need to keep in mind here that the we want to sell this for for twenty five Euro, we want to m make an overall profit for the the company of fifty million Euros so we're we're looking at selling a lot of these ag across the the entire planet and and we're looking at a gross profit of fifty percent. It needs to cost twelve Euros fifty to make.
It needs to cost twelve Euros fifty to make.
would anybody like t like to to start by giving their o sort of quick views of of current remote controls. I think I find a lot of them really complicated to use with all the different buttons and it's handiest when you have one that works both the D_V_D_ player or whatever and the T_V_ as well., but that it's easy to if you can switch back and forth instead of having to press a bunch of different buttons so I think it's is best when they're clearly labelled and you can see which buttons you're supposed to use, Or anybody else, strong feelings about remote controls? I think it's important that you should be able to when you when you press the buttons it'll actually pick up the signals from kind of anywhere and you shouldn't have to like contort yourself Think a lot of the time, remotes that come with T_V_ players and T_V_s and D_V_ players, like they aren't they're very boring, making a a stylish remote control would be a very like Easily put us one step ahead of the current competition.. Something that looks looks doesn't look like remote control. I mean do you think there's a risk if it doesn't look like remote control, people won't see it as a remote control I think something that's comfortable to hold because sometimes you get the remote controls that are just those big, rectangular things so something that's more comfortable that fits in a person's hand better. that instead of being raised out of the device you push into device you see, like a mouse button. remote is a piece of plastic with the big rubber buttons sticking out of it whereas if you want could all be flat I mean the only thing is if if you're watching television in a in a a darkened room you need to be able to fi find the button buttons easily. But maybe they could be concave instead of sticking up to have them be kind of down must admit I don't think I've ever seen one with
w welcome to the the first meeting of Real Reaction's development meetings for our our new television remote control. taking advantage of the the the latest developments in in technology and the the latest feelings in in consumer design and and demand and we want to make this the the very best product th that's possible for everybody, at a good price for the consumer and at a good price for the company. I'll just go round th the table, Andrew, marketing, m Kendra with the designing the the the User Interface and Kate with the the industrial design.. ev everybody is is free to say wh whatever they want, everybody has a contribution to make
The the further work to be done is i the the functional design, what it what it must actually do, the conceptual design, how we actually present that to the consumer and th the the detailed design i is how we get that into production.
now th the main design tool that we have available to us at the moment is is the white board and let us very quickly do what i what it says in the in the in the prompt slide here, In fact I suggest to avoid everybody untangling themselves from the the the wires, that we don't do that, everybody knows what whiteboard is so we'll we'll do a virtual drawing on the on on the whiteboard of of your your own favourite animal, but le let's go round the table,, badger. probably a duck 's horses, I think homo sapien
if if if anybody wants to b briefly give their their background in fact we will do that by by going round the table quickly my name's Andrew I'm a I'm the Market Research person for this for this meeting and this project for creating this new remote control and yeah I'll be presenting information statistics on what people want to want to get from this new design, what people want to like and from a fashion point of view and the practicality point of view. I'm Kendra and I'm the Us User Interface Designer and I haven't had a whole lot of experience in this kind of thing before I'm Katie, I'm the Industrial Designer and I'll just be I guess presenting about the the inter workings of our little remote control
but briefly th th this is what we want to do. The the remote control needs to be original, there has to be something about it that other remote controls don't have and that goes along with being trendy, you know the I want it scenario. User-friendly as as we all know, remote controls can be very user-unfriendly And last but not least, or indeed first of all, it it must make the company money,
the n the new requirements are the the management team see that teletext is no longer of any importance given the the rise of the internet.
We're looking at extreme simplicity. We're looking at a radically different shape. Possibly no buttons at all, but if you can incorporate channel change and volume buttons in into the design, then then that's fine. I don't see why we shouldn't go for voice recognition and the the only buttons that I think we need are channel control, volume control and on off. and there's no reason why we can't introduce interchangeable covers. it needs to incorporate the corporate logo, the the grey and yellow colour scheme Yeah. We are doing just the television. are we doing just the television so not D_V_D_ players, I think that's quite clear from the the information that we've been given, we can all give some thought to that for for the next meeting,
I think your point about the the big energy source is a very valid one. I don't suppose we've got any statistics on the the life expectancy of remote controls, particularly sort of independent ones. you know, the number of things you buy these days, which you know, have a a a lithium whatever battery in, perhaps we should have the the disposable remote control, the the the battery will last know, five, ten years. p perhaps we should, know, reduce the, you know, the sort of moving parts even more by not even having a battery compartment Just having one that's guaranteed to last five to ten years? it's actually a marketing gimmick. it's it's totally practical. so I th think you know the idea of a rechargeable one is unless you're really high tech and it sort of just recharges itself if it's n by, you know, magnetic waves or whatever, It could have like know like a cordless phone in your house it s got like a base that sits there all the time. I mean people forget to put their cordless phones back on there, 'Cause I only remember to charge my cell phone when battery dies. what so wh what what do we think about the the the permanent battery?. That sounds pretty good, yeah. Do they make batteries that last that long? but there are certainly things that you buy. I mean calculators for example. Yeah, they have that little solar Most of them, don't they have sort of a combination of the two, when there is light, they'll work off the light, and if there isn't, they'll kick into this battery, so we can maybe do something like that I mean the the actual time that a remote control is actually operating I would think is i is is probably, you know, no more than minutes in its entire life. like like this this market research thing says number of times per hour that it's used, channel selection a hundred and sixty eight That does sound excessive.
I'll just do my presentation on the working design. the basic function of the remote control is to send messages to another sh system, the the T_V_ or the D_V_D_ player or whatever. and it does this by well, you need to start off you need an energy source and this energy source will feed into an integrated circuit chip and the circuit chip is the part that actually composes the different messages within the remote which will then be sent to the the television, the D_V_D_ to tell that what to do. and you need a user interface, which controls the chip and thus the messages and the user interface is that's basically just you kn the s sorta design of the actual remote which you hold in your hands and what buttons will be on it. what we need technically speaking for the remote control is some sort of energy source, some sort of user interface, which I think we've mostly been talking about the user interface and the design of that. a circuit chip within that to control and send the messages and a sender and receiver. This is just sort of a little schematic diagram of what we're looking for. my personal preferences I I just think we need sorta big energy source that won't die out, perhaps some sort of rechargeable battery or a battery dock you could place it in, so you wouldn't have to be worrying about it running out of batteries and not changing channels for you. also definitely a user-friendly interface and I think we've all sort of mentioned adding a a locating device on it,
this is just about the technical functions. the method, I looked online for examples of other similar products and then just kind of was trying to brainstorm some possible design ideas and then there are two different kinds that I found. There's a user centred one and an engineering centred one these are the two different ones. This one this is the user centred, it has quite a few fewer buttons and then this is the engineering centred, which has a lot more buttons, what a remote control is is you it's to send messages to the television set, turn on, off, switch the channels and the volume and things such as that. And so for this product it's gonna be television only, and then it has to have the logos for my personal preferences, I think this one is easier to use and has quite a you know, fewer buttons. we want something that sends messages easily to the television and I was thinking maybe if it were wider at the top, then that would be easier. the unique style, maybe have it light up the changeable face-plates, maybe to have a button on the television that you press and it maybe if it makes a noise or lights up or something like that, when we were talking about havi losing it,
the device has to incorporate the company logo and colours.
and and they want it only to cover televisions.
rather than the the the traditional something like this shape, sort of something that you can that's sort of a more vertical shape, l l such as I mean something you hold up like that, We're looking at a radically different shape.
but they also want it to be simple to get it to the market quickly, We're looking at extreme simplicity.
I was possibly even thinking of a design that maybe some of the buttons are hidden from everyday use. Maybe like a folding ledge or something. So that we can maybe go into the channel settings and the audio settings, And keep the v volume selection and channel selection very easily I was just gonna say maybe like the flip phones that they use? you could have the most used buttons on top like the one that like slides back and the buttons are concealed underneath. If people really don't use those buttons to any extent at all remove them altogether. I wonder whether we could get the remote control with no buttons at all if we went for voice recognition, what we didn't have was what proportion of people using remotes were in those particular age groups. Forty no sorry for forty five to fifty five age group, to put myself right in the middle of it, u use remote controls to a great extent. again, we don't know the relative proportion the relative numbers in the age groups. If we wanted something different, truly different, then the buttonless remote control w would be it. the only problem I can think of with that is if you've got a lot of people that don't wanna be bothered learning how to use new rem remote controls. But if you just lift it up and say, channel one or B_B_C_ You could just put it down once on top your T_V_ and then it doesn't matter where in the room you are, I can I can see technical problems with that in terms of the, you know, the sound from the television, because if somebody actually on the television says, you know, I_T_V_ and you're watching B_B_C_ then then it might change itself, so it probably needs to be possibly actually need a button on it Or or something just to identify that you've lifted it up and it's use. w we need to s identify things that people actually need and and it's a function of frequency and relevance. if we
these are functionality requirements from the our our guys down in the the research lab. Took hundred people and covered all the aspects of what is needed by people and what they want to see. everything kinda from functionality and how individual functions are how mu how how often they're used and how much their necessary and stuff. And general opinions about current current remotes. See that, as we kinda noticed, seventy five percent of people find their remote controls ugly. along with looking less ugly, if it looks better, eighty percent of people said they'd spend more money on it. Current remote controls do not match the operating behaviour of the user. I kinda take that to mean as they they don't they, yeah, they only use they only work for the television as in in my flat I've got six remote controls for a stereo system, a digital box, a D_V_D_ player, a video player and T_V_. again, seventy five percent is seventy five percent of users say they zap a lot. fifty percent users only use ten percent of the buttons, we'll have some buttons taken off by the lack of teletext, but oh and we're going to see on the that some of the functions like audio settings aren't h hardly ever used So I think maybe fewer buttons, which also make the design look sleeker, frustrations of like people losing remote control. maybe some kind of system of you press a button on the T_V_ it would have to incorporate, but like some kind of system where you can f use something else to find the remote control. Maybe like it'll beep or something. the time taken to learn new remote controls is And repetitive strain injury, I suppose we should make it more comfortable like I was saying about the whole mice the mouse idea of it feels more comfortable. Maybe don't even have to hold it as such. It also asked if we would if people would pay more for speech recognition and younger people say they would. And there was another section on
I'll shortly ask for for three three presentations. before I do that, however, I will go through some new project requirements that the the management have placed on us the the ma the management has had it's own thoughts on this and the they don't necessarily agree with with what we we thought. the n the new requirements are the the management team see that teletext is no longer of any importance given the the rise of the internet. and and they want it only to cover televisions. what is not q quite clear from their directive is whether they mean th they don't want it to cover teletext or whether they don't want it to cover, you know, videos, D_V_D_s, satellite boxes, which I mean we saw as being fundamental to the to the exercise. The the actual wording of the directive is that it should cover television only. the device has to incorporate the company logo and colours. the the logo being at b the bottom of the screen there, the the the two R_s in grey against a yellow background. this doesn't necessarily mean that we have to give up some of our ideas about making it attractive to the t to the market. but they also want it to be simple to get it to the market quickly, but we we need to talk that through.
welcome to the second meeting of this design group. I'll briefly go through the notes of the of the last meeting we we s we saw that the the problems with existing remote controls were the b a boring shape and boring colour. and and we s we saw that the what we needed to do was to to make sure the device controls several items, that switching was easy, that you shouldn't need to point the thing at anything in particular, that it need to be contoured to make it interesting, that the keys might be concave, should have interchangeable fascias illuminated and that people might want it as as in addition to their existing remote controls. And that it shouldn't be too small, that it it gets lost..
I can I can see technical problems with that in terms of the, you know, the sound from the television, the only problem I can think of with that is if you've got a lot of people that don't wanna be bothered learning how to use new rem remote controls. I wonder whether we could get the remote control with no buttons at all if we went for voice recognition, because if somebody actually on the television says, you know, I_T_V_ and you're watching B_B_C_ then then it might change itself, so it probably needs to be possibly actually need a button on it Or or something just to identify that you've lifted it up and it's use. you were saying about it could technical problems of like someone on the television saying a channel number and it changed we could maybe have like an activation I don't see why we shouldn't go for voice recognition
S s we could we could make it dual function voice recognition and still have buttons on it and has quite a you know, fewer buttons. if minimum number of buttons is our priority, then we should, as I say, r know, really bite the bullets and and reduce the buttons to absolute minimum, possibly with backup channel and volume buttons and on off. and nothing else. but if you can incorporate channel change and volume buttons in into the design, then then that's fine.
and there's no reason why we can't introduce interchangeable covers. the changeable face-plates,
the the the battery will last perhaps we should have the the disposable remote control, know, five, ten years. so I th think you know the idea of a rechargeable one is unless you're really high tech and it sort of just recharges itself if it's n by, you know, magnetic waves or whatever, It could have like know like a cordless phone in your house it s got like a base that sits there all the time. I mean people forget to put their cordless phones back on there, what so wh what what do we think about the the the permanent battery?. That sounds pretty good, yeah. Do they make batteries that last that long? but there are certainly things that you buy. I mean calculators for example. Yeah, they have that little solar Most of them, don't they have sort of a combination of the two, when there is light, they'll work off the light, and if there isn't, they'll kick into this battery, so we can maybe do something like that
and somehow between the combination of that two we might be able to come up with something that will last the the lifetime or the five to ten years
And Kate and Kendra will be producing a a model for us to to look at. Kate and Kendra now go away and pa play play with a bit of Plasticine or play-dough, and actually put what we've discussed into something I was gonna say concrete,
Kendra the ho how the the user actually uses it
and whatever happens next year, we can have the face plates, With interchangeable covers, could just buy a new one every year, a new one when new fashions come out. depending on the cost of the product itself, you know, could we have a cheaper b cheaper power source and then just have it annually renewed? Instead of having a ten year guarantee? What if we included the batteries in the cover? but if we also make it cheap enough that people either change the cover every year or even buy a new one every year then it it's it's even better. I I think it's easier sometimes to have them buy changeable covers for it than to buy a whole new one, That all c also kind of encourages 'em to buy new covers whereas the advantage of having it plumbed in is that that the whole thing is all, you know, completely soldered together I mean the the the the immediate thing that comes to mind with that is that it it it y you've then got the connection and, you know giving people the option of buying a new a a complete new thing, the advantage of a replaceable cover is that even if they don't it doesn't have a cover on at all, it will still work totally. that that's just it with the covers, you're sort of tricking 'em into continuing to spend their money on our products without making 'em feel like they're being ripped off having to buy a new product. and, you know, as as external fashions change, then we get new new covers on the market and, you know, readily available. I i interchangeable case seems to be important to the concept. it it should be cheap, you know, if if we avoid any, you know, electrical connections. i if we can come up with some way of of allowing people to actually personalise it to whatever they want, then I mean this is totally new.
and then, you know, f for the next meeting Kate will be looking at the the the s the look, feel and design,
inevitably a b a custom design chip is gonna be more expensive. And and do we know how long it'll take to develop a a custom chip. a lot longer than an off the shelf chip. maybe we can like cut corners somewhere else to bring in over cost.
and and Andrew of course the the product evaluation. and Andrew n can go away and th th think about how we can actually market this as a concept and not j not just a a a simple remote control.
and the custom-designed will give us much more flexibility so if we were definitely gonna go with the the voice option we'd probably have to design our own chip. given that the the technology is not well developed and and given that it's it's never been done before, perhaps we ought to stick to to buttons,
it it should be cheap, you know, if if we avoid any, you know, electrical connections.
And you know, th the the design that I've got, and and it could be a a home-made design, you know this says this is not just a a television remote control, the fashions apply to furniture, It's the sort of thing that we want people to have prominent dis displayed on their coffee table to say this says something about me. I mean given that we've got you know one one on off button presumably, two buttons for channel change and one slider and basically nothing else, w we need to decide on the just the basic shape of the thing. And, know whether we go down the fruit and veg route, and I don't suggest we make it look like a banana, but know sort of the the organic, you know, curved look, t to deliberately get away from the you know, the the the the square look of most current remotes and, you know, whether whether the you know, the the fixed part of it is the corporate yellow. 'cause there's certainly you know, the the corporate logo needs to be prominently displayed I dunno that we should make the whole thing yellow yellow seems a bit of a strong colour I mean we're we're we're simply it's simply required to incorporate the the the the corporate logo prominently. I was sort of kinda picturing like maybe a shape that's almost like a mouse. because a mouse is pretty comfortable to hold in your hand maybe we could make it a slightly different shape but that way they can have the volume on the side and then the channel buttons and my idea was something a b probably you know a bit fatter than this but sort of tha that sorta shape so that you can just sort of ho hold it. you'd want it narrower than a mouse though 'cause it a mouse you're kinda just resting on it, you want something you can definitely grip. so it's you sorta hold it in your hand like that, i with, you know, and fiddling with the buttons. kind
I think we've actually very conveniently just come to a good point to s to sum up. Kate and Kendra now go away and pa play play with a bit of Plasticine or play-dough, and actually put what we've discussed into something I was gonna say concrete, and Andrew n can go away and th th think about how we can actually market this as a concept and not j not just a a a simple remote control. we're all clear where we go from here. thank you very much indeed and I'll s see you all again in thirty minutes.
But the television would be the display We actually use the television, okay. Okay, okay, okay.
so I did some research on the internet the interf user interface are just aspects that are seen by users, commands and mechanisms for the operation, and there're just kind of a variety of choices. findings, a lot of times they tend to look cluttered and these were just a couple examples of different kinds that are a little bit more unusual. There're some special ones available, like this one right here, which is marketed towards children, different designs, and one of the things that n we need to watch out for is a V_ in volume Bring a little picture of what I thought ours could look like.
We could have the channels and the power and then a menu button and then the volume.
just kind of minimise the clutter, avoid too many buttons and also one of the things that people have used is a slide button, like you have on a mouse, that possibly we could use that on the sides for volume, for example, have the slide button on the side, I mean I think the reason everybody uses pushbuttons is that they're they're si simple, cheap and reliable. I think they're they're about the same cost really. there's a lot of slide buttons out there. Okay, fair enough, fine. for example if I'm using a mouse I like to be able to slide it up and down so I thought it might be good for volume to just be able to kind of roll it and then have the up and down So three three there's three buttons on a slider. The only advantage I was thinking of to having the buttons, like the buttons on one side for the channel, and then the slider is that if you're just holding in your hand, and you pick it up, it's easy to n s know, okay, this is just the volume and this is the channel. 'cause I've definitely picked up remotes and like meant to change the channel and turn the volume, or vice versa, so it'd be kinda good to have them be feel completely different. like the shape of it almost like a mouse, so we we're looking at sliders for both a volume and channel change I was thinking kind of just for the volume, in that kinda position the fingers would be better for pressing and the that for rolling,
I think we d I think we decided that w we're actually going down both routes. we're leaving out the buttons for the the f less frequently used stuff, but maybe we could incorporate that into the voice. you can still i incorporate the voice with with less buttons.
this is my report on trend watching. The data's come off internet from executive summary for us on the top three things wanted by the consumer. And we got reports from Paris, Milan on new fashions. And the most important aspect is the l the look it has to look fancy, look and feel instead of the current functional look and feel. I was gonna say yeah twice as important as the second aspect, which is the technologically innov innovative side of it. and the third being easy to use is probably a given, I think that what we're suggesting ought to address all three of those. from the fashion watchers from Milan and Paris have said fruit and vegetables are an important theme for clothes and furniture and shoes, et cetera. clothes, shoes and furniture and a spongy material to be used on the on the outside. that's different, certainly. if we're going for the it looks fancy, then fashion is obviously the line we gotta be going through. But fashions do don't last very long. that can kinda tie into our changing face things, like we could have the fruit and vegetable theme this year and whatever happens next year, we can have the face plates, we can have a sp like a spongy skin on it Also means you can drop it without damaging it. depending on the cost of the product itself, you know, could we have a cheaper b cheaper power source and then just have it annually renewed? Instead of having a ten year guarantee? With interchangeable covers, could just buy a new one every year, a new one when new fashions come out. it's like the old Swatch watch where on only batteries ever got changed in those, 'cause people just bought a new one when it went out of fashion, I mean my feeling is that current power sources are such that for relatively little cost you can make it last, you know, a long time.
I was sort of kinda picturing like maybe a shape that's almost like a mouse. you'd want it narrower than a mouse though
and the custom-designed will give us much more flexibility
What if we included the batteries in the cover? Oh yeah. I like that. but if we also make it cheap enough that people either change the cover every year or even buy a new one every year then it it's it's even better. I I think it's easier sometimes to have them buy changeable covers for it than to buy a whole new one, That all c also kind of encourages 'em to buy new covers I mean the the the the immediate thing that comes to mind with that is that it it it y you've then got the connection whereas the advantage of having it plumbed in is that that the whole thing is all, you know, completely soldered together and, you know giving people the option of buying a new a a complete new thing, the advantage of a replaceable cover is that even if they don't it doesn't have a cover on at all, it will still work totally. then if, you know, if people lose the cover, I mean they they might be well inclined to go out and spend however many Euros on a on a new one rather than a a complete new re remote. that that's just it with the covers, you're sort of tricking 'em into continuing to spend their money on our products without making 'em feel like they're being ripped off having to buy a new product. it's it's up to our marketing people to to ma to ma turn it into a a fashion item. and, you know, as as external fashions change, then we get new new covers on the market and, you know, readily available. like they have for mobile phones that are just fruits and animal prints and colours.
Thank you for coming to this third meeting of the design group. I'll again very quickly just present some notes of that meeting. the the the problem with existing remote controls, we felt, was that they're ugly they've got lots of buttons on them that people don't use and people lose them. that we're we should look at speech recognition rather than r rather than buttons, and that if we have any buttons they should be very few of them and only for those functions that are actually identified that that people use. we want to go for a long lasting battery and a shape that will be instantly recognisable, A_ as a trendy remote control, and and B_ as a Real Reaction product. again, I'll we'll have the three three presentations from the the the three of you and then we'll we'll make a a final a final decision. and the the decisions that we need to to make today, finally, are what energy source we want to use, And I I think our discussion was around the fact that if we're gonna go for a long lasting power supply, then basically it's sealed for life and this is where I need Kate's expert advice d d do we go for a custom designed chip? Or or do we buy one off the shelf and and programme it ourselves? we we had some discussions last time as as to how we might go forward and we'll we'll finalise those da today. and thi this is all linked in with the the the user interface, and then, you know, f for the next meeting Kate will be looking at the the the s the look, feel and design, Kendra the ho how the the user actually uses it and and Andrew of course the the product evaluation. And Kate and Kendra will be producing a a model for us to to look at.
I'll just be talking about the components design. basically I just looked at what exactly do remotes do. basically they wait for you to press a key or give a voice command and then this is translated into light signals which are then seen by the T_V_. the materials we're gonna need to look at the two big ones are the integrated circuit chip and the battery and the in integrated circuit chip works in conjunction with a a diode transistor or resonator, two more resistors and a capacitor and the battery works in conjunction with a resistor and a capacitor.. basically what happens is you'll press a number or give a voice command and this creates a a connection within the the remote the chip then senses this connection and produces a signal in a Morse code format. This signal's sent to the transistor and then sends it on to the light emitting diode which is then trai changed into a infrared light as for how we should end up using this in our remote t couple of main questions are the buttons. y the fewer buttons you have, I guess the fewer internal connections and internal codes you're gonna need. however to n not have buttons or to use a voice commands instead of buttons might make these connections more difficult Also we have to work within the company constraints, and the company has informed me via email that they're experts at pushbuttons and that seems to be the most cost-effective way of producing it.
the materials we're gonna need to look at the two big ones are the integrated circuit chip and the battery and the in integrated circuit chip works in conjunction with a a diode transistor or resonator, two more resistors and a capacitor and the battery works in conjunction with a resistor and a capacitor.. basically what happens is you'll press a number or give a voice command and this creates a a connection within the the remote the chip then senses this connection and produces a signal in a Morse code format. This signal's sent to the transistor and then sends it on to the light emitting diode which is then trai changed into a infrared light also with battery connections the company has some limits on the batteries we can use, so I was thinking perhaps a combination of solar cells with a back-up basic battery and somehow between the combination of that two we might be able to come up with something that will last the the lifetime or the five to ten years we also need to look at the chips, v custom-designed versus off the shelf, and the custom-designed will give us much more flexibility and enable us to incorporate the voice function that we all seem to have agreed upon., however that's gonna cost more, but the off the shelf is gonna be cheaper but it's going to be less flexible with the features, especially things like voice activation, so if we were definitely gonna go with the the voice option we'd probably have to design our own chip. inevitably a b a custom design chip is gonna be more expensive. Do we do we know by how much? I don't actually have any price information, And and do we know how long it'll take to develop a a custom chip. a lot longer than an off the shelf chip. I think we need to make a a decision here. given that the company wants this on the market quickly and cheaply, that would appear to effectively constrain us to an existing chip and thus therefore
Welcome to the what should be the last of these meetings the th the the minutes of the last meeting I think we'll take those as read, the th the the next thing we we we'll have a look at the th have a look at the prototypes and look at the evaluation criteria and finance and then just tidy up with production
we basically have the same kinda lay-out here you hold it like this and it gets kinda moulded to the to the shape of your hand, basically. on the left we've got the scroll for the volume, on the right we have buttons for the channels up and down and that kinda so you can hold it and scroll, or you can hold it and and push. this is the power key, it's kinda like the biggest that's the little menu key. This is the infra-red section we got a microphone there which for all the voice commands so you can you know talk to it like that the logo is down down there and has the cover on it the red bit's the cover and it kinda goes over everything and then there's holes for the buttons to come through.. for some strange re reason I had it in my mind that they'd put them down vertically we could broaden the broaden it out a bit but as you say you can just make the base a little bit bigger if we just lengthen it I guess so it comes down to the base of the hand The final product would actually stand up, yeah. I think the the basic concept i i is is absolutely bang on
And so we figured it would be kind of you know a light weight plastic, just kind of a light non-descript grey and then the covers will be that sort of rubbery material like they make iPod covers, so they kinda just stretch over. spongy like is something that people wanted and it just sort of stretches over But it's also e e easier to put on versus like mobile covers and then the buttons come through each one of 'em on the very end will have the logo with the yellow circle and the R_R_.
let's have a look at the f finance. if I get the spreadsheet up. this is the company's costing for for various aspects of design and I I I've treated some of these slightly liberally given the constraints placed on us, for instance if if they require us to have it in the corporate colours, then that is not a special colour, we're just simply on batteries, the the one th the one decision I've had to make is that we're we will have to find a s a regular standard chip to to do this with and I I I'm I'm I'm certain that they they are around that I don't think is a a serious problem. The the the voice sensor is is expensive but we we made a a basic decision that that was absolutely fundamental to the to the design so that that has to stay. it's simply made of plastic so th that's that's no problem we haven't actually got a scroll wheel we we we got push buttons and and a simple slider I do don't know that they're special colour. then again the the the the shape of the case means that it's it's expensive to l to make 'cause of the the th the double curves
the the costings come in at exactly on target at twelve point five but I thi I think we have a a very strong case to argue that what what we've got is is so in innovative and and different that any any slight compromise we have to make on on cost is is offset by the you know the you know the the the the concept of it being a a fashion accessory and and having the the interchangeable covers if the management expect us to be techno again fail again technologically innovative that they they have to accept that we we can't operate absolutely within the constraints that they give, I I think we can argue that we we have come in on on budget..
Andrew do you want what do you want to say about the yeah the evaluation Method of evaluation testing the product was to just if it met all the criteria all the conditions that we set out to set out to solve, from the point of view of the the consumer and the management. what I've been asked to do is, on the whiteboard gauge our team response to these questions. on a scale of one to seven, one being true and seven being being false. And then at the end just take an average look at these questions. Is the device f flashy and fashionable? I think most definitely. I'd say definitely a one yeah. and also technologically innovative? Yeah, defi yeah, yeah the voice technology indeed. Easy to use? I don't see we could've made it any easier. suitable for the consumer? Yeah definitely. I think it made we met all of the consumer is it complicated? No. functional? Yeah definitely. found easily. We've b built in the the speech, where are you, function. Does it take long to learn to use? No, not at all. The R_S_I_ compares to the current standards, Less buttons it is sorta the the handle more ergonomically correct as well. will device appeal to all age groups? I think it will because I mean old older people who can't manage the buttons anyway will actually probably like the like like the voice bit so we had the we had the data saying that old people will be less likely to pay extra money but the funct the increased functionality, the e ease of use of the device might make up for that. I I I think it will tend to appeal more to younger aged groups I think we can reasonably say it's another another one, in in in in my interpretation of management's instructions is that yes it it meets the requirement it's it's simple to use, it's it's it's within budget, I I think we've done an amazing job one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven.
Eleven divided by eleven's one so equals average of one.
I think we worked well together and looked really at what the consumers wanted and what we were trying to make th this this slide here I mean the satisfaction with room for creativity, seemed to discuss things pretty well I think we've allowed ourselves as much creativity as the the the the product allows. I won't comment on leadership, teamwork I think we've I think everybody's worked pretty well together. we've just about coped with the whiteboard and digital pens, and new ideas found,, again gi no given relatively everyday product, I think we've v very very effectively come up with a a new a new approach. are the costs within budget? Yes. Is the project evaluated? We're we're all happy that it it meets all the criteria,
Thank you very much indeed, Cool, thank you, So I call the meeting closed.
And so we figured it would be kind of you know a light weight plastic, just kind of a light non-descript grey
and then the covers will be that sort of rubbery material like they make iPod covers, so they kinda just stretch over.
we got a microphone there which for all the voice commands this is the power key, that's the little menu key. on the left we've got the scroll for the volume, on the right we have buttons for the channels up and down and that kinda
then again the the the the shape of the case means that it's it's expensive to l to make 'cause of the the th the double curves
the the costings come in at exactly on target at twelve point five I I think we can argue that we we have come in on on budget.. that any any slight compromise we have to make on on cost is is offset by the you know the you know the the the the concept of it being a a fashion accessory and and having the the interchangeable covers if the management expect us to be techno again fail again technologically innovative that they they have to accept that we we can't operate absolutely within the constraints that they give,
I was just wondering if that's the If fifty percent is normal I would think would be more like sixty percent.
this is the kick-off meeting for the day. we're the new group to create a new remote control for Real Reaction. As you can see our agenda is to open up the meeting, become acquainted with each other, have a little training on tools, create a plan, discuss things and and we only have twenty minut twenty five minutes total. The new remote control is to be original, trendy and user-friendly. That, Steph, is your part, is the user-friendliness. The originality is gonna take all of us. the trendiness we'll probably go look at for some marketing research information from you, Sarah. we'll have a functional design individual work with meeting and then conceptual design t and then detailed design.
we have to get down to the nitty-gritty of how to make this and this remote control has to be sold we're to sell it for twenty five Euros, the production is to only cost twelve and a half Euros per item.
the production is to only cost twelve and a half Euros per item.
Everybody's supposed to try out the whiteboard. Kate, why don't you try it first, if you can either bring your things with you, I guess we'll try and figure out how to hook these things on as well, 'cause we're all gonna have to be able to walk around. you want an animal and the characteristics of that animal. Its a sort of bunny rabbit cat. I think it's to get us used to using the pen. Not a mouse, a rat. a fish. And I think your pen's running out of whatever.
Experience with a remote control. Any of you use of remote control for a television or D_V_D_ or something? That that that's the sorta product we're talking about, one that will work for a in a home environment, for a T_V_s and I've seen some remote controls that are for more than one device at a time, but I also have heard about them not working well or not well co-ordinated and you wind up working with this one for thi this three and then this one over here for another. that you always sit around you know, you're sitting on your sofa and you wanna change something, there's five different remotes, and one for the D_V_D_ and one for the video and one for cable and one for whatever else. And they don't always talk to each other. But I presume this is t I presume this is just for television. We could make a Hello Kitty themed remote. I think one in b bright colours would be good. I think one that works would be good. We could totally go for the Japan-a-mation. I mean there's also the cachet that the Japanese make great products. I think one that doesn't have lots of superfluous functions. Like I've got one at home that has well, apart from the obvious, channels, channel up, channel down, volume, you know, subtitles, mute, there's a lotta buttons that I've got no idea what they do, like. that's a really good point, because I think one of the things that being somewhat computer literate, we tend to go to menus and then make choices, so if it's like an volume button, you know, you can go in and say mute or or volume. We don't need to have like the l the numbers if we also have channel up channel down.. We can make it smart like an iPod, make everything menus.
with a profit aim ultimately of fifty million Euros. That tells you something about how many we have to sell on an international scale. would be like what, a hundred million of them to make twenty five Euros on each one and to make a total profit of fifty million. if they cost twelve and a half, you're selling it for twenty five, you're making twelve and a half Euros each. and we're to make a profit of fifty million, I was just wondering if that's the If fifty percent is normal I would think would be more like sixty percent. you gotta know how many we're going to be selling to know how big a market you have to target and who is that. In order to make fifty million Euros, and you're only getting twelve and a half each four million. You'd have to sell four million.
and this remote control has to be sold we're to sell it for twenty five Euros,
Our functions, we've so far decided, I think, that power, channel, volume make it attractive.
so that we'd be looking for the younger end.
It has to have big user-friendly buttons
it has to have an enter key and of course the number keys.
Do we have ki some idea of how much it would cost to create a device that has these basic elements?
In real numbers, does the ninety one percent and the seventy six percent translate to ex in excess of the four million?, I'm I'm I'm hoping that my personal coach is gonna give me some advice on that, if you're asking me, but I think you raised some good questions about are there enough of these people out there, or are they making purchasing decisions? are they necessarily buying T_V_ remote controls? Bu but what I was gonna say was, although they they may be buying, you know, personal music devices and all that,
it's better than my idea about solar, probably. solar may not be so good when you're watching T_V_ in the night, It would have to sor store up the energy M yeah, that would be too heavy and it'd cost too much.
for you, Steph, to do the user interface
that teletext is outdated
or are they making purchasing decisions? Bu but what I was gonna say was, although they they may be buying, you know, personal music devices and all that, are they necessarily buying T_V_ remote controls?
your individual assignments are for Kate to do the components,
which is if every time you're done using the remote you put it on a charger, then you then it has a place. But then again I d I don't know if this is within our price range or not. I think that's a very interesting idea, and I don't know much about what these things cost. but for long-term use it'll be so much more convenient and economic than fiddling around trying to replace chunky A_A_ batteries and not having any in your kitchen drawer but just a rechargeable internal battery would probably I mean it might cost more to at first to develop and to install, do you think we might make that a selling point if it was something that we found we could afford to develop? Still I don't know if it's quite within our price range.
Are we agreed as to what our target group is though? so that we'd be looking for the younger end. but I think you raised some good questions about are there enough of these people out there, or are they making purchasing decisions? Bu but what I was gonna say was, although they they may be buying, you know, personal music devices and all that, are they necessarily buying T_V_ remote controls? It might be good to know who, you know, who's actually buying televisions Or do we s make sure that it goes to the man through the manufacturer? We sell to the manufacturer as the remote that goes with it. That's probably more what it is. We're not gonna get any resolutions by the end of the day, Our functions, we've so far decided, I think, that power, channel, volume make it attractive. the other thing that we're supposed to do is make decision on our functions. It has to have big user-friendly buttons it has to have an enter key and of course the number keys. and sh n definitely we wanna be inspired that the current styles are just plain awful. my only comment is I think maybe we could somehow include an enter key in like a power key if power power was enter and pow that was my only just really in terms of streamlining. Enter, power as a s oh a sum simultaneous key. H how does that work? how do you avoid switching the thing off when you actually wanna press enter? if you're pressing enter, the the thing would already be on, and so maybe when you press power, initially it turns it on, press power again and use that as an enter Then you'd have to have an off te off key. I was thinking maybe you to turn it off you'd have to press power twice in succession, It's not getting a bit complicated? Or something that has a a turning dial, where at the far end is on or off. It's definitely channel, volume, power. things like screen settings
and for you the trend-watching.
with incorporating the corporate image, colour and slogan.
Although what what suddenly came into my head is, you know how they always take two A_A_ batteries Could it be possible to have, you know, like a rechargeable internal battery, like, well, like an M_P_ three player does? With that you could jus or a mobile phone or whatever. You could you know, you just plug into a power source for a couple of hours, and then it's recharged for ages and ages and ages, and you don't have to worry with replacing A_A_ batteries, which is if every time you're done using the remote you put it on a charger, then you then it has a place. And it's not stuck down the back of the sofa. But then again I d I don't know if this is within our price range or not. I think that's a very interesting idea, and I don't know much about what these things cost. it's better than my idea about solar, probably. solar may not be so good when you're watching T_V_ in the night, It would have to sor store up the energy M yeah, that would be too heavy and it'd cost too much. but for long-term use it'll be so much more convenient and economic than fiddling around trying to replace chunky A_A_ batteries and not having any in your kitchen drawer but just a rechargeable internal battery would probably I mean it might cost more to at first to develop and to install, do you think we might make that a selling point if it was something that we found we could afford to develop? And the dock could look very fancy Sort of have its little dock that you could put it in. Still I don't know if it's quite within our price range.
but that they want this remote control to only be for T_V_
I wanna bring us down to earth again I'm afraid and talk about the actual practicalities of how the thing needs to work. I've been doing a little bit of web-based research, But the the net result is that I've come up with a first cut for the working design that I'd like to discuss with you. let's go back to what the basic function of a remote control is. It's for sending a message, typically via infrared. And the the basic components we've got to build in for our twelve Euros fifty are an energy source, the user interface which will in incorporate an integrated circuit that actually composes the message based on what the which buttons the user presses, we turn that into a message, and then we need a sending mechanism to send it to the receiver. we want an energy source And we've got to think about what that might be. typically it would be a battery, but I'm open to suggestions. then we have the the user interface. And the main components in there are the the th the chip that translates button presses into a message, and sends the message to the receiver. what what does it look like? What do the buttons look like? That's where the user interface is really coming into its own. The technical end is what's actually gonna be in there, or what if the chip, for whatever reason, breaks down after a certain amount of time, do you just replace it? does it have to have a a way of being segregated from the others, in a different frequency or something? but I'd been thinking of this device as being a a cheap mass-produced device. I may be wrong here, and I hadn't thought of it as being a reparable thing, I like the idea of speech recognition, that's a great idea, but I'm not convinced we can put it into this box for the price that we need gonna need to hit. Do we have ki some idea of how much it would cost to create a device
my only comment is I think maybe we could somehow include an enter key in like a power key if power power was enter and pow that was my only just really in terms of streamlining. Enter, power as a s oh a sum simultaneous key. H how does that work? how do you avoid switching the thing off when you actually wanna press enter? if you're pressing enter, the the thing would already be on, and so maybe when you press power, initially it turns it on, press power again and use that as an enter Then you'd have to have an off te off key. I was thinking maybe you to turn it off you'd have to press power twice in succession, It's not getting a bit complicated?
technical functions design. I think first off, basically I do agree with what Sarah has defined as as your personal preferences,yeah. I think we need a more streamlined volume with no extraneous functions. my method was to look at the existing remotes and what functions they have. And what we all need to discuss is whether we want these functions pretty much the same as what existing remotes have. If we can build on this with the speech recognition, that's not something I'd thought about at all, and and I presume we can miss out the functions really to to a video or D_V_D_ remote control, if this is only gonna be a, you know, satellite, cable, T_V_ remote control. these are two models of existing remote controls. the one on the left seems to be a fairly standard universal remote control. It has fast-forward, stop, play, all relating to movies. It also has seems to have channel up and channel down, but I think we should be looking more along the lines of the one on the right, which has it also has play, stop and pause and everything, I don't think we need them at all. I think we just need channel selection, volume up, volume down and I think an an enter function where you can access it's not like teletext, but along the same lines, access things on the screen. not related to the internet one that you mentioned, because that'd be far outside our budget and what we want this to do. I was thinking something some smooth, sleek, little remote control with big user-friendly buttons and a menu that you can access. but then I do think we need to discuss the speech recognition possibility. But we could go back to the pictures of the, what're they called? The pictures of the remote controls and possibly discuss what we think about them, I think the white that one on the right is, as well as less cluttered, The the style of these is terrible. not only possibly even materials, like the type of plastic used
that's looking at age groups. and I'm making and I'm making the the leap that people who are familiar younger people are l are more familiar with technology than than older people. Or comfortable, I think the most important thing is an attractive streamlined remote control and to be extraordinarily reductionist, power, channel, volume and everything else is is up to the designers.
One of the the biggest issues I found about from last meeting was the fact that we need to sell four million of these remote controls and I think that this is an opportunity to really take Real Reaction in the direction of of similar of handheld tools that have been used and are used by many of us and to kind of bring the remote control into the si same realm as an accessible useful electronic device, as opposed to something that is lost in the couch and what have you. my main goal here is to re-envision the remote control in in this context and to think about menu functionality and current technology some of the research in the market has shown that people really are not happy with remote controls as they are now, and that means we do need to make some decisions about what what keys or or buttons on the on the remote control to perhaps keep and and what ones to discard. And if we devote some energy into this, I think the recent productions of Real Reaction, the I go everywhere power and the high definition D_V_D_ players although it makes immediate sense to have our remote control interact with these, I think we can also use this as a platform to make it interact with other tools. again, most users really dislike the current look and feel of remote controls. fifty percent of user say they only use ten percent of the buttons. eighty percent would spend more money on a remote control that looks fancy. Could can I ask where these figures come from, it was market research and there were a hundred people in the room, so eighty out of a hundred said they would spend more money. and s specifically wanted to find out information about speech recognition. the early adopters, those of us who grew up with technology and luck lucky for us have the cash to to pay for it, the young age group without the mortgages and responsibilities, ninety one percent of them would pay more
Welcome to this second meeting. This is a meeting on functional design. I did took the minutes from the first meeting and I'll show them to you in a moment. I know each of you have a presentation and in thinking about the forty minutes, I thought it would take only like three minutes for the previous minutes, each of you having about seven minutes or maybe a little more, maybe a little less for your pre presentations and a little discussion, because there's I happen to have been told there were some new project requirements and we have to make some decision on what functions it will have. for the minutes of the first meeting. the product was developed and reviewed, and we talked about the financial end of it. and it had some implications, the four million sales target and new ideas of not too many buttons, bright colours and some of the influence of the Japanese. Did I miss something? we we we talked about the the individual roles that we each had as well. as a group I think we've are they're accepting the minutes., then we'll move to the three presentations.
I'm afraid I don't have that information available. do you have any idea if if this could if the fancy model could be done in twelve Euros fifty? manufacturing didn't actually give attach any prices to any of this, I'm afraid.
You were saying that the kinetic would be useful, I i in terms of workability, I I think the the two front-runners are the standard battery or the kinetic, What's the feelings of the group on the kinetic? I've used kinetic in terms of watches you don't even notice that it's there. I've never come across it before, but it sounds fantastic. it would make the whole thing a lot lighter, more convenient. a good selling point. So the consensus seems to be use the kinetic if it's at all possible. But it does depend how much I mean how much it costs and how much more development and research it needs..
Do you not think it might need like a kind of a hard plastic inner shell with the actual delicate workings inside, and then a kind of spongy Yeah, s thick spongy cover,
Do you not think it might need like a kind of a hard plastic inner shell with the actual delicate workings inside, and then a kind of spongy Yeah, s thick spongy cover,
like four buttons, up, down, left and right with enter in the middle, that will correspond to a menu on the screen. I'd like push buttons with
I suppose rubber is the closest to spongy, I was thinking titanium myself. I think many of us would associate those with fancy. I have been influenced by pictures of iPods, I mean titanium would be great, And and I definitely support the use of plastic and or rubber. but I think it might be a bit too expensive and too kinda spacey. we can't for example have a double curved case in titanium unfortunately. If we're k trying to keep it colourful and slightly organic, then I think titanium's too futuristic.. We we could actually do it in rubber instead of plastic if you'd rather if you feel if you like the spongy
we need to come up with some specifics of the components, the materials, things like making the decision on the energy and the case and the interface type things. They want us to decide what form of energy are we going to use, which the choices that we've discussed were pretty much battery, kinetic or solar. You were saying that the kinetic would be useful, as opposed to a battery that you have to either put it in a recharger or keep replacing the batteries. or solar that you'd have difficulty with it if it's a dark day, that it'll die on you, and no way to do it. unfortunately I don't have costing information. I i in terms of workability, I I think the the two front-runners are the standard battery or the kinetic, What's the feelings of the group on the kinetic? I've used kinetic in terms of watches you don't even notice that it's there. I've never come across it before, but it sounds fantastic. it would make the whole thing a lot lighter, more convenient. a good selling point. So the consensus seems to be use the kinetic if it's at all possible. But it does depend how much I mean how much it costs and how much more development and research it needs.. the next thing that they wanted us to do was look at chip on print as a decision. chip on print is just a manufacturing technique and I would certainly recommend it, I think, what about the case? I think they're talking there about do we want wood, plastic, titanium or rubber, Do you not think it might need like a kind of a hard plastic inner shell with the actual delicate workings inside, and then a kind of spongy Yeah, s thick spongy cover, and I think we've discussed not having titanium. we've sort of eliminated wood. We said plastic or rubber. I'd I'd need to talk to manufacturing again about whether that's actually possible, but I agree, it's sounds like a nice idea if it is. the next part they want
I don't actually have a huge amount of different information then what Kate says, just that my method was to look at the, well, my my inspirations, which was a big collection of lots of different models of remote controls and other things that use a similar sort of thing, including M_P_ three players, like you know, hi-fi remotes, not just television and these things. having a think about the feature of ea the features of each ones, I've been especially interested in the iPod style scroll wheel, what functions we actually need, but it had a similar thing to this thing on the right. It has scroll wheels without without a display, So I was thinking that a really simple a really simple interface with just a couple of scroll things on it and then instead of a display the display could appear on the television screen. and it comes up with what's showing on that channel at the moment, you can scroll along and you can see what's on the other channels while you're watching the same channel on the screen. but I'm also equally taken with this chunky plastic kiddie remote, which is really nice and fun and good to hold and nice, big, easy buttons to press, but still quite simple and quite cost effective. what seems kind of ideal for me would be to just have a fairly simple, not fancy but not totally minimalist, I mean just pretty simple plastic, probably, I was thinking, yellow and black, just because that's the company's colours, with very very few buttons, but that would correspond to a screen that would appear on the television screen, like, you know, just small along the bottom Yeah, I'd I'd certainly support that idea. But as for actually arranging them let me go back to the to the picture of the kiddie one. And I quite like it, 'cause it's just smooth and hand-held and it's got these easily reachable buttons so something a bit like that with buttons arranged in a kind of circle. Up, down, left, right. Do you want
And they actually want a look and feel design, user interface design, the look and feel design is for Kate,
Marketing they want product evaluation. you get product evaluation.
What's hot, fruit and veg. Spongy. And this is all over the catwalks, Paris, Milan, and I'm talking about clothing, furniture, shoes. This is really interesting change from past years, because it is much more organic, And I think if we're to refashion our view of what we want in a remote control, we should perhaps think about incorporating technologically interesting fabrics and some of the bold colours into a simple handset. on what again are the most important priorities in decision making about purchasing. Functional is out. Fancy. And f the fancy, and that's exactly the term, I'm I'm thinking polished, elegant, you know, kind of innovative, but a cut above. This is twice as important as the next finding, which is technologically innovative. This is interesting, 'cause I think in the last meeting we were talking about technology as being so important, but maybe what's innovative is having it simple with with technologically superior fabrics or, you know, designed in interesting substances. Ease of use. Again, pretty low, I mean it's the top three, but each of the fancy and technologically innovative are far more important. I think we should cloak the streamlined remote control device in a series of fruit fruit themed sleeves. It sounds like the the covers that they use for the remote, you know, your t your cell phone. I was thinking though that instead of having something like patterned, you know, so, you know, something similar to a summer dress. you know, it would have like fruit and veg, is that we actually make these spongy. initially I thought we could start with kind of fruit that would suit kind of a long hand-held, so banana, pineapple and pear. They could be interchangeable, they're spongy, So what we're talking about is changing. this concept. Everyone has a T_V_ remote, but the person who is really perhaps active in personalising, I'm thinking the teenager, the someone fifteen to thirty five would go out and get this additional thing the same way as you mentioned that people would get the cell phone covers. So I really
first thing I want to address is one of the points that Florence brought up, which was current cost of the competition devices, and and they're twenty to sixty Euros, depending on branding. But I think that with the current price that we're searching for, we're well within, even on the lower end, of the of the market. I investigated the remote control market in greater detail, and my the theme of what I was to work on was trend watch. What's hot, fruit and veg. Spongy. And this is all over the catwalks, Paris, Milan, and I'm talking about clothing, furniture, shoes. This is really interesting change from past years, because it is much more organic, And I think if we're to refashion our view of what we want in a remote control, we should perhaps think about incorporating technologically interesting fabrics and some of the bold colours into a simple handset. on what again are the most important priorities in decision making about purchasing. Functional is out. Fancy. And f the fancy, and that's exactly the term, I'm I'm thinking polished, elegant, you know, kind of innovative, but a cut above. This is twice as important as the next finding, which is technologically innovative. This is interesting, 'cause I think in the last meeting we were talking about technology as being so important, but maybe what's innovative is having it simple with with technologically superior fabrics or, you know, designed in interesting substances.

I think we should cloak the streamlined remote control device in a series of fruit fruit themed sleeves. It sounds like the the covers that they use for the remote, you know, your t your cell phone. I was thinking though that instead of having something like patterned, you know, so, you know, something similar to a summer dress. you know, it would have like fruit and veg, is that we actually make these spongy. initially I thought we could start with
And they actually want a look and feel design, user interface design, Steph gets the user interface design,
you're gonna be a little disappointed with some of the things I have to tell you, I've been looking at the the basics of how these devices actually have to work in order to operate, and I've had some discussions with the ma manufacturing division, who have told me what's actually available, you know, what the current state of the art in components is, and some of the exciting new things they've got, this is the innards of a remote control. and that's the the back of the interface. And this is a push-button one, so you see these little little buttons here, they're little rubber rubber buttons that go through onto the the board at the back and they push these buttons here. that's the basic construction that we've got to got to accommodate. We got to have something that pushes the little buttons that talk to the chip that encodes the message that sends the the message to the receiver. So first of all I wanna talk about what possibilities we've got for the energy source. we can have your bog standard double double A_ batteries in a replaceable little compartment. We can have a hand a wind-up, yeah, but i it maybe is doesn't quite go with the the fruit and veg. one that one that I think is quite interesting is the kinetic energy source, where you you actually get the energy by moving the device, Or we we had talked about solar power, but I thing that we agreed that that's not so good in the dark. I'm afraid this is the options we've got on on the case. It can be made of plastic, rubber, wood o if you like, or titanium. and the nearest we've got to st to spongy there I guess is rubber, and basically it can have a flat surface, a curved surface or a double curved surface, but I think if we wanna use standard components, we're gonna have difficulty with anything much beyond that. what does the interface look like? push button, that's that's the one we're all familiar
the two of you get to play with a Pla modelling clay to do a prototype.
I I think we're gonna have some trouble when we get down to the component design on this. Spongy is gonna be difficult, I'm afraid. And as for as for well budgeting as well, if we're gonna have lots of different interchangeable components. we can make these things out of wood, titanium, plastic or rubber. I suppose rubber is the closest to spongy, I was thinking titanium myself. I have been influenced by pictures of iPods, I think many of us would associate those with fancy. it would be a a very simple product that would have a spongy sleeve that would be interchangeable. So Perhaps perhaps that desi that particular suggestion needs to go back to management W w would it be helpful if I described the components a bit, I think possibly it might be more useful if Kate went next. I was really thinking a lot about the I_ the iMac kind of gel gem tone.
So the consensus seems to be use the kinetic if it's at all possible.
this is the beginning of the third meeting, the conceptual design meeting. our agenda should be that we're opening the meeting, the minutes from the previous meeting are on the shared f drive at this point. and we should each have a presentation to make. we have certain decisions to make there are the decisions we have to turn to, but we'll come back to them in a minute after I take us to the minutes of the previous meeting. Sarah, you presented a marketing research report which pretty much rep represented that fifteen to thirty five year olds it has to be hand-held, power, channel, volume, number keys, possibly a speech recognition. And then Steph did a second presentation that those functions plus streamlining them with big user-friendly keys that were easy to use. Kate presented a working design of going after going over the basics on the whiteboard that it should be a simple mass-produced device, because of the twelve and a half Pence cost. but we did talk about possibly using rechargeable batteries and having a docking place as a selling point. we agreed that the target market would be fifteen to thirty five with more money than sense, that were decision makers. Alternatively it would be a manufacturer to enclose it with the T_V_, and that the function we agreed was volume, power, numbers, enter, channels, a way to move between channels, easy to use and hand-held. at that point we agreed that Sarah would look at the current cost of competition, what what do the current ones sell for. and Steph was gonna look at ec ergonomics. Kate was gonna look at cost and feasibility of the various possibilities that we discussed.
There was no decision made on the curvatures or double curvature or straight. It looks like it single curve, What does double curved mean, I don't understand. you can do a banana in single curve,
And we've therefore we have to do the final questionnaire and do the meeting summary,
So what we re really need to decide is whether we want the actual banana shape or just a a purely blob or some sort of abstraction in between the two but that isn't actually recognisable as a banana, you know, with the grooves and the stalk and stuff, I think that many of us are abstract enough to look at the yellow one and say we'll call it the banana. And of the two I really like I m I like the banana, that's maybe not something we have to decide just right now, I think between the two, somewhere between the two is true.
And we've therefore we have to do the final questionnaire and do the meeting summary,
Yeah. They could be plastic, we don't have to have rubber buttons,
go to the project evaluation, next slide. the project process, satisfaction with, for example, the room for creativity. leadership, Sure. teamwork, Yes. means, of having whiteboard, the digital pens and all that kind of good things. Yeah, yeah, the Play-Doh was best, I thought. 'cause I mean it's so hard to describe what you mean just with words and pointing at photographs and saying, well we quite want this, but imagine it rounder. and we're satisfied with all the above. we went over all those things did we find any new ideas? I think with the marketing element of fruit shaped I I mean I that really opened my eyes. Spongy. And I'd never heard of the kinetic energy before, Good work as a design team, I'm not sure all the wires are really great though.
and the total cost has been calculated as nine Pounds twenty out of the twelve and a half we were allowed. More profit.
and the next big thing is the finance. And we're going to raise what's called a sp a spreadsheet it says fill in the number of components you plan to use in your device. Hand dynamo, battery, kinetic, solar cells. just kinetic then,. Electronic simple chip on print, and we'll need one of those. 'cause we've just got push buttons, and we only need one of those. the case will be uncurved and flat or a single curve or a double curve. It looks like it single curve, What does double curved mean, I don't understand. I I think you it means you reverse the curve. you can do a banana in single curve, case material supplements. Plastic, wood, rubber, titanium, special colour. I just wanna say plastic. I mean I I still quite like the idea of combining plastic and rubber myself, Okay. We'll come back, if we can, to the rubber being added And the buttons Wha what is the buttons made of, rubber? does tha does special material mean that plastic is not a special material? Button supplements, they'll be in a special colour of black. 'Cause I think they can be plastic. Yeah. They could be plastic, we don't have to have rubber buttons, We had the special colour.
we're down to the prototype presentation. well you see, each made one, This is the one that I made. It is curved, easy to hold, hand-held, nice and small with big easy buttons. This is like a scroll, but they are push buttons and they enter takes you into the different menus. And it's gonna have the logo imprinted on it in there. the function of these buttons is up, down, left and right in the different menus. The main feature of it is just a simple design, simple, lack of buttons all over the place. Form curved, kind of smooth, hand-held, but I think we have two different options, material, I think Kate's gonna tackle that quite a bit, because we did make a another one, which wa is in the shape of banana, if you can imagine this as yellow with black buttons, like just like this but in the shape of a banana, which is also nice and easy to hold and has a similar sort of scroll push button technology, just a slightly different design. I had envisioned it in hard smooth plastic. Whereas otherwise we'd thought, like with this one a more spongy rubber cover with spongy buttons. we have the two options we can follow, either the smooth hard plastic or the spongy rubber, depending on cost restraints. colour, I think I definitely have a preference towards bright yellow with black buttons, but if anybody's got any other suggestions, I'm quite willing to consider them as well. maybe, Kate, you better say what you think about them. I don't have very much to add. The the case can be either spongy rubber or hard plastic. We're not absolutely sure about a combination of the two, We have simple rubber push buttons I thin as for as for the fruit or organic theme, I guess this one is obviously fruit shaped. This one has no obvious connections to fruit, it kinda makes you think sort of organic, touchy-feely, kiddie, you'd expect it to be like a child's sorta toy remote control instead of a real one
Button supplements, they'll be in a special colour of black.
Our agenda is, as before, for me to open the meeting, for us to go over the previous minutes, then for the two of you to present your prototype and for you to g Sarah present the evaluation criteria. We then have a finance aspect, And I know what you're all thinking of, oh my, because we're only given a forty minute time period to get it all in, including the production evaluation. So we're going to make a very fast track. each of you made your presentations. we discussed the various possibilities based on what was presented in those presentations. The market trend of fruit and veg, spongy, fancy and elegant more than technologically innovative and that more than easy. we decided chip on print would be used. we would use plastic with a rubber casing, I think was the consensus, powered by kinetic energy. There was no decision made on the curvatures or double curvature or straight. looking like a scroll, but it's really a push button technology, excuse my spelling that was actually in use, we decided that separate fashionable covers covering your fruit and veg might be a separate product and as suggested yellow with black buttons with the company logo, a slogan and image might be a good idea based on the requirements that have been provided to us. and we had some conflict of ideas and cost constraints
I just wanna say plastic.
We had the special colour.
It looks like it single curve, you can do a banana in single curve,
'cause we've just got push buttons,
I can give you a number, the average evaluation score is one point eight eight, There were six true or ones, two s almost true or close to true, and then one false, seven points, And the the only false one is because we've chosen to keep a simple old technology, which if it works perfectly well I see no point in improving on if it works,
This is going to be a heavily interactive evaluation, this means we're going to go over the priorities that were raised by the consumers a as well as incorporate all of our insight into this evaluation exercise. I'm going to go and use the whiteboard, and I've made a list of criteria to look at, but for the evaluation it's going to be one is true and seven is false, going over these different criteria, fancy, technologically innovative, easy to use, trendy, buttons, excess buttons, good buttons, ugly, sellable, and other. And in fact I hope that you all introduce some additional terms, some of them seem rather close, what about price, is that gonna go on there as well? Price of materials. We'll put price up at the top. Not that we actually know anything about it, wha how do we feel in terms of is this fancy? It depends what what you mean by fancy really, I'd call these quite minimalist, a plain, simple, clean design. it is heavily reliant on appearance instead of pure functionality, I think just maybe we need a different word other than fancy, like stylish or aesthetic. in terms of elegant, fancy. we'll call it E_F_, do we do we think that perhaps and maybe we should say the yellow? they're both yellow with black buttons, but if you can just imagine banana shape with these bits as black. So what we re really need to decide is whether we want the actual banana shape or just a a purely blob or some sort of abstraction in between the two but that isn't actually recognisable as a banana, you know, with the grooves and the stalk and stuff, I think that many of us are abstract enough to look at the yellow one and say we'll call it the banana. And of the two I really like I m I like the banana, that's maybe not something we have to decide just right now, I think between the two, somewhere between the two is true. It's more true than false, about a two. technologically
Electronic simple chip on print, and we'll need one of those.
because we did make a another one, which wa is in the shape of banana, if you can imagine this as yellow with black buttons, like just like this but in the shape of a banana, which is also nice and easy to hold and has a similar sort of scroll push button technology, just a slightly different design. I had envisioned it in hard smooth plastic. I thin as for as for the fruit or organic theme, I guess this one is obviously fruit shaped.
it is gonna be environmentally friendly with the kinetic energy. just kinetic then,.
This is the one that I made. This is like a scroll, but they are push buttons and they enter takes you into the different menus. And it's gonna have the logo imprinted on it in there. the function of these buttons is up, down, left and right in the different menus. The main feature of it is just a simple design, simple, lack of buttons all over the place. Form curved, kind of smooth, hand-held, Whereas otherwise we'd thought, like with this one a more spongy rubber cover with spongy buttons. This one has no obvious connections to fruit, it kinda makes you think sort of organic, touchy-feely, kiddie, you'd expect it to be like a child's sorta toy remote control instead of a real one, I could see this thing, unless it's reinforced, having a problem with the Breaking, that's why hard plastic would be quite a good thing for it,
I mean I I still quite like the idea of combining plastic and rubber myself, And the buttons Wha what is the buttons made of, rubber? Yeah. They could be plastic, we don't have to have rubber buttons,
I have a final report to present,
, we want it to cost,, absolute maximum of twelve Euro and fifty cents.
, and make it for an international market.
Yes, it's a television remote control.
, you will get specific instructions,, of what to do in the next half an hour.
, we'd like to, to,, make fifty million Euro.
, wanna make this selling price of twenty five Euros.
, U_I_D_ the technical functions design will, will be worked on the next thirty minutes.
Industrial Designer. You'll be beginning your, your working design.
, like you can go over your ideas, of course, in your own personal times., our next meeting will be in half an hour. Industrial Designer. You'll be beginning your, your working design., U_I_D_ the technical functions design will, will be worked on the next thirty minutes. and,, we need the user requirements from the manag Marketing Expert., you will get specific instructions,, of what to do in the next half an hour.
, the next,, thing we need to address is our financial department, to meet our our budget,, wanna make this selling price of twenty five Euros. we can like the price to create it will be significantly less., we want it to cost,, absolute maximum of twelve Euro and fifty cents. so we'll have a hundred percent profit then? So this is time for us to bring our initial ideas, any suggestions that you may have so far, I find that in the dark it's often hard to know what button you're pushing., we'd like to, to,, make fifty million Euro., and make it for an international market. I always find that in our house the remote control always goes missing. So maybe if you could have some kind of tracking device for the remote control or some signal that you could find out where it was. There's some remote controls where there's kind of a hidden panel, so all those buttons that you don't really use unless you're programming or something. Do yous not find that,, like, there's a lot of,, buttons on your remote control, and you don't know what half of them do. Are we going into kind of novelty factors here. I suppose, if we're he heading to have it, like make a huge profit out of this, it needs to be quite a universally accepted thing. And the key issue here is, is being trendy and original.
And,, as a sort of team-building moment,, I, I'd like us to,, try out the whiteboard by expressing our favourite animal and the charac characteristics of that animal. My favourite animal, which changes all the time, okay, right now it is an elk. like all sorts of animals, but for the moment I'm gonna draw a cat, in memory of my poor cat that died recently. and it, it is my favourite animal right now, 'cause it is a large beautiful majestic creature, But I like cats because they're so independent, I think my favourite animal would be a dog,., I like dogs because,, they're so good to humans, I'm going to draw a butterfly, because I saw a butterfly yesterday, that seemed to be like the symbol of Spring arriving.
and then,, after we've brainstormed and, and thought about, we can come together in a meeting and, and discuss what, what, what kind of functional design we want to use. Same with conceptual design and detailed design.
And tool training is one thing that we're going to be doing today, as well as planning the project, as a team we're going to be designing and creating a new kind of remote control., we want this to be a marketable product that can be trendy,, a completely new style, so that,, can really appeal to a, to a generation that doesn't want a simple plain kind of,, channel-changer. And,, it needs to be user-friendly for,, maybe, for an example, for people that,, can't see the numbers as well, Yes, it's a television remote control.
Welcome to the meeting everyone. This is the first meeting for developing our, our new product. I'm Heather, I'm your Project Manager. If everyone could go around and explain their role and, and their name.
and,, we need the user requirements from the manag Marketing Expert.
Would we be the company that would break down these, or metals? One thing we have to consider is our one hundred percent turnover goal that we have for our financial sector., so we'll have to investigate how much that will cost us, cost the company, And,, the next presenter will be Tara. There're two functional design options. A multifunctional remote control, which can be used for several entertainment devices. And a single function remote control, used specifically for the television., multifunctional controls can be difficult to use, as the multitude of buttons can be confusing. A single function remote control is simpler to use, but it means you have to have other remote controls for your other entertainment devices., I think that a single function remote control would be preferable, It'd be more compatible with a range of television sets, making it more internationally sellable. And it would be more profitable as it would be more simplistic. And less functions would have to be included. So it would be cheaper to make.
So as far as we know,, a single function television remote control is us usable internationally?, I was just wondering about the, what, what Genevieve said before, about having like some hidden controls like having the outer casing. And that would probably,, I d, well well what you said before about it being a more profitable simplistic design. Does anyone object and, and find the multifunctional might be a better way to go? because we're trying to do so much, that if we're trying to make a unique, user-friendly, dadada, and it's also multi also multifunctional,, we're gonna go over budget for one thing. And with this we'll have more room in the budget probably to make a more original design.
Okay. So I'll be discussing the functional requirements of this remote control., I've done some marketing research, a lot of interviews with remote control users,, and some internet research. and firstly I wanted to remind you about our company motto and purpose. So we believe in providing international market with fashionable products., hence our motto, we put the fashion in electronics., and we should also be looking to trends in clothing and interior design. Not just in electronic fashion. Any trends that are going on in, in the public, even media,, seventy five percent of users of remote controls find them ugly. Eighty percent of users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy. Current remote controls do not match well the operating behaviour of the user., seventy five percent of remote control users said that they zap a lot., and fifty percent of users say they only use ten percent of the buttons. And actually to go with that, I'm gonna give you some statistics on the relevancy of the buttons, how much they're used. Channel selection is used a hundred and sixty eight times on average per hour. Teletext,, now I'm not too clear on what that is., and has a r a high relevance of six point five. Remote controls are often lost somewhere., remote controls are bad for R_S_I_. an L_C_D_ screen though might be something that, you know, you can shift through pages kind of li the way this PowerPoint is working.
so it might be very appealing if,, we have very concise buttons. And another thing with lots of surfing, we'd probably have to work on something that could be a lot more durable, So it looks like something that we're gonna want to do some research on and include on our remote control. But we'll have to also avoid, you know, buttons responding to the slightest touch as well. So I guess we're gonna have to figure out what age group we're, we're targeting, and if and if voice recognition is something we wanna look into., I think our priority really should be unique design. so in my opinion it should be,, user-friendly and unique., I th myself, voice recognition kind of scares me off. I mean if we wanted to concentrate on fifteen to twenty five years olds, we could go for the fancy stuff. But if we wanna make fifty million, and and have everyone want this remote control, we should maybe stick to the basics., so I I think, I think the older generations we should be catering to a bit more.
welcome back fro to the second meeting. the first presentation we'll be looking at is Poppy's presentation.
, so I was looking at how we're going to go about the working design,, on a functional side of things, we found out that wh from our previous meeting, we decided that there're certain points that will make our product unique., one is the visibility in the dark, And we could use illuminated buttons, Or we could use fluorescent materials, also we could use an alarm. So if we lost the remote control, perhaps there could be a button on the television set itself, which you could press,, another thing I think we d missed out on on the last meeting was the fact that we should consider the environmental impact of our design. also there is components. But I haven't put this plan together yet. This would actually show the circuit diagram. Although I haven't come up with the final circuit yet. I it just shows what sort of energy source. It could be a battery,
, another thing I think we d missed out on on the last meeting was the fact that we should consider the environmental impact of our design., from previous researches I've carried out on other projects, we've learnt about smart materials where specific alloys of metals have a shape memory. So they can be heated and and cooled, and they change the shape of the metal. So, the benefits of this for our product would be that when it came to the end of its product life, if it was heated, everything would spring apart. So, all the individual components could be easily separated, and then some could be reused, some could be recycled, I mean, the user would return the p product to the company, 'cause it's the product's responsibility to get rid of what they've made.
, so we'll have to investigate how much that will cost us, cost the company, We'll have to do more research.
We could, may, possibly, sorry, incorporate them both so that the buttons could maybe be in the shape of the numbers themselves and be made out of some glow-in-the-dark material.
I think that we should incorporate that. You could start out with three, and if, if we hit it big then we can add some on.
I think we should definitely go ahead with the alarm system idea that you had.
, the glow-in-the-dark, fluorescent, whatever, system, is a go ahead. So we've decided on lighting up things.
So,, all the remote controls must have our We'll incorporate our logo and colour in in some way.
So no L_C_D_, no teletext, and no voice recognition.
, so we'll have to investigate how much that will cost us, cost the company,, the environmental factor, we didn't bring that up again. We'll have to do more research.
because we're trying to do so much, that if we're trying to make a unique, user-friendly, dadada, and it's also multi also multifunctional,, we're gonna go over budget for one thing. And with this we'll have more room in the budget probably to make a more original design., for one thing, because Having controls with D_V_D_, V_C_R_, that sort of thing, would really complicate the design of the remote control., we've decided not to include them and make it a specific, just a specific television function.
Another thing that might affect other decisions is that the management feels that teletext is outdated, because more people are using the internet now.
Would it need a battery then? So,, more research into that one.
I think that we should incorporate that. You could start out with three, and if, if we hit it big then we can add some on.
Before we go into more discussion on we want this design to look like, I've received some information from the management that will affect some of our decisions., for one thing, because Having controls with D_V_D_, V_C_R_, that sort of thing, would really complicate the design of the remote control., we've decided not to include them and make it a specific, just a specific television function. Which is good as, as we've sort of decided that we would like to go with that anyway. Another thing that might affect other decisions is that the management feels that teletext is outdated, because more people are using the internet now. So,, all the remote controls must have our We'll incorporate our logo and colour in in some way. but for the purposes of this meeting I, I wasn't offered a, like a type of logo or colour, It's probably R_ R_R_ in yellow.
, so, now we need to discuss, and come to a decision on our remote control functions, of, of how this is going to be. Are we going to write off the L_C_D_ option? I don't use teletext that much, but if it was on your T_V_, you'd want to be able to use it, It was a management decision, so it's, it's pretty much out of our hands at this point., well I guess, just from my findings it looks like we wanna minimise buttons. I think we should definitely go ahead with the alarm system idea that you had. Would you be able to,, put the little device anywhere? so it would need to be something that you could stick somewhere, or something. It would be able to use the same reception on the remote c control I guess, but the actual device would have to have its own infrared signaller. So,, more research into that one. Would it need a battery then?, the glow-in-the-dark, fluorescent, whatever, system, is a go ahead. right, if w if we're minimising buttons, we might be able to make them actually larger. We could, may, possibly, sorry, incorporate them both so that the buttons could maybe be in the shape of the numbers themselves and be made out of some glow-in-the-dark material. I just thought that it, it might be sucking more battery power, if there, if it is a light up., so like big b buttons, for people you are visually impaired. I guess the other option, referring to the battery thing is, you know how cellphones will t light up for fifteen seconds or something, when you're s and then it goes,, if instead of a constant light up on the, on the remote control, if it lights up for ten seconds when it's touched again. That's probably feasible., did we want to go for the glow-in-the-dark look? Or did we want to go for the lighting up instantly? Because it might, for, for our design purposes, I mean, the lighting up thing might be better because glow-in-the-dark material has a
And, okay, in closing, 'cause we only have five minutes., you'll be working, Poppy will be working on the look-and-feel design. And you'll be evaluating the product. and the user interface design, so this is where the trendy stuff comes in. Poppy and Tara will have to work together, using modelling clay. And,, your personal coach will give you the rest of the information of what needs to happen.
Yeah, it's the fruits and vegetables is the only area that I find rather jarring. It's, it's a little but it, it's everywhere. I think we possibly could take a more abstract design. Like look at the basic shapes of different fruits and vegetables. I mean we don't have to make something in the shape of a strawberry, but it could have the curves of a strawberry, or something. I dunno if you all remember from our kickoff meeting, we talked about our favourite animals. So maybe there could be animal-based, you know. Energy, we've decided on kinetic, right? I, I think we should just like take advantage of like using this to its full potential. It could even be one of our selling points. I think we decided on the pushbuttons, right? Would we need a more advanced one for the lighting, the interior lighting system? So regular chip., so that's the simple. is regular not simple? because of the lighting that we've decided to put in as well. Well, I guess plastic and coated in rubber. yeah, interchangeable plates. and supplements. What's that all about? what we're gonna do about the cluster of button functions, colours and forms, in the in consistent use. We haven't really decided what to do about that. just just the basic button functions. Like we, I don't know if we can make a remote that would be universal to all the different kinds of So we're just going for power, channels, volume, Should we have audio? it's a problem with the international appeal, I think., if we have audio because we don't know how other televisions work. We can just go for, make it a selling point that it is just the basic. 'cause it, it is a good sales ploy to say, aren't you annoyed with remote controls that have all these buttons.
, you'll be working, Poppy will be working on the look-and-feel design.
So the actual remote would be hard plastic and the casings rubber. Well, I guess plastic and coated in rubber.
just just the basic button functions. So we're just going for power, channels, volume, We can just go for, make it a selling point that it is just the basic.
and the user interface design, so this is where the trendy stuff comes in.
The fruits and vegetable themes, I don't know if that's going to work for us. Yeah, it's the fruits and vegetables is the only area that I find rather jarring. It's, it's a little but it, it's everywhere. I mean we don't have to make something in the shape of a strawberry, but it could have the curves of a strawberry, or something.
Poppy and Tara will have to work together, using modelling clay.
Should we have audio? it's a problem with the international appeal, I think., if we have audio because we don't know how other televisions work.
And you'll be evaluating the product.
'cause it, it is a good sales ploy to say, aren't you annoyed with remote controls that have all these buttons. We can just go for, make it a selling point that it is just the basic.
And,, your personal coach will give you the rest of the information of what needs to happen.
And we will once again have Poppy as our first presenter., first of all we have to look at how the remote control is actually made,, thes main internal feature is a circuit board, which contains all the elec electronics and also the contacts with the power source., there are several components of,, the circuit board that we need to consider, where we'll be getting them from, what they'll be made of., including the integrated circuit, which is also known as the chip. they're all separate, apart from the chip, which we will probable decide whether we buy a simple, a regular, advanced. so we've got flex flexibility with colours and things, with that as well. Okay, there are lots of different possibilities for the energy source. We could use a basic battery, There's a hand-powered dynamo which is a sort of thing that was used for torches fifty years ago. Kinetic energy is something that's been recently developed. Whereas kinetic energy is a new idea that's being used by some watches and other devices, where you just shake the device and it gives it power., or there's solar power, which we've been considering inside a building, which is where it's gonna be used, might not be quite so useful., lots of considerations for the case, like what sort of shape it would be, curved or flat. We don't want something that's huge and you can't pick up. we could use metal, we could use rubber which might be more ideal for the anti-R_S_I_., titanium is not gonna be possible, even though it just it beyond our budget really. right our choice for buttons as well. with our research team have found some new multiple option scroll buttons. they're basically quite a flexible design, modern, you don't have to use individual buttons. one thing with the scroll buttons though. we would have to have an L_C_D_ and the glow in the dark thing might be difficult., also we've got the integrated pushbutton, which is what we're most familiar with. My personal preferences? I think we could go for the kinetic energy
I think we're gonna go with the command interface anyway, to make it more simplistic.
Well, welcome to the third meeting of conceptual design. on the agenda for this,, for this particular meeting, we'll have your three presentations on what you've done since our last meeting, after we came up with some general ideas of our design. And,, then we have to make some key decisions on, on our remote control concept, and how we're gonna make it, what materials we're gonna use, and that sort of thing. The meeting will be forty minutes long.
so we have that taken care of., the temporary light-up idea, sounds like we're gonna stick to that.
But if we're having a simplified display anyway, w that, we probably won't have to focus so much on that. It'll be more the on the numbers and the volume. It'd be more a command interface, I think we're gonna go with the command interface anyway, to make it more simplistic.
and I'd like to stick to that. of course, as we, we've already talked about the personal face-plates in this meeting, yeah, interchangeable plates.
, I'm just gonna go through the interface concept with yous now., first of all I'll explain what a user interface is., there are two types of user interfaces. There's the graphical user interface, which emphasises the use of pictures for output and a pointing device, for example a mouse for input control. I'm not really sure about the pictures that maybe that's on an L_C_D_ screen. So you must, for the graphical user you must need some kind of presentation for the graphics. No I think it's to do with the actual symbols that are on the, that's on the buttons of the remote control,
Energy, we've decided on kinetic, right?
this report is about trend-watching. And the recent fashion update,, according to fashion-watchers in Paris and Milan, is that fruit and vegetables will be the most important theme for clothes, shoes and furniture., also, in contra in contrast to last year, the feel of the material is expected to be spongy. of course, as we, we've already talked about the personal face-plates in this meeting, and I'd like to stick to that. The fruits and vegetable themes, I don't know if that's going to work for us.
I think we decided on the pushbuttons, right?
We, we also have to keep in mind when we're designing our,, more user-friendly remote control, that a lot of interfaces consist of a clutter of buttons, that their functions, colours and forms aren't always helpful. It can be a bit, yeah, overwhelming. But what about the lighting up effect?, well,, I thought we had decided that we would if you touched one of the buttons they'd all light up. I kinda pictured it as kind of coming from the sides and lighting it up frontwards. I'd assume, like, an internal light, that comes through. So there would have to, have to be some parts maybe transparent around the buttons, or something. and well rubber is a more translucent product too, Each face could have its own colour of buttons maybe? 'Cause if it's just like constructed in the same way as like the front cover of a mobile phone. You can like take off the hard cover and then there's the like say the buttons. I don't think it would matter that the buttons were bigger through the, the top casing.
So regular chip.
Alright so based on this evaluation, do we average them out sorta thing? Yeah it is one point nine.
we went for like a a circular design for the numbers Okay, as for the colours, we were presented with a limited range of colours for this prototype.
Do we have a fancy look-and-feel? We've been quite successful with the rubber coating The look is a little bit more playful. Yeah I guess that depends on your definition of fancy, I mean th the colours we were given for making the prototype aren't the colours that I think we would've necessarily chosen. I mean diff if you can visualise this in nice colours I think it would look quite fancy. I kinda I like the potato look. It's a two? Okay so question number two was is it techn technologically innovative? So I know we have the kinetic energy which is very innovative. and the use of the rubber. and we don't have any scroll buttons, it's all pushbuttons, there's no L_C_D_ control, so if we're thinking about the rest of the market, it's sort of probably halfway. we didn't want it to be any more innovative than this, because then that would've defeated the purpose. we'll put three, but I think we actually reached our goal., will it be easy to use? Yeah. One. you can't really get confused with that. The plus number thing. But once that's figured out, it should be fine. Is this a good-looking remote? Again I think the colour comes into this. I think that the logo could be smaller. Remember the management said that it it had to be prominent. I like the appeal of it being like a big glob in your hand. where's it gonna sit in your living room? the bottom could be like ch chopped a bit. But then it wouldn't sit as comfortably in your hand. Would we wanna show it off to our friends? Okay, so should we say two for that? will people be willing to spend twenty five Euros on this product? I think we have to market it in the right way, that to say that it is simplistic. And the kinetic energy part. No, I guess, I don't know much about the remote control industry, how much your average sells for, About ten pounds. But you don't have to buy batteries. So
I mean we weren't really given a lot of time, or materials, yeah, to go about our design task. Like we were very creative in in coming up with an idea I guess, but m and like if we had decided to use the L_C_D_ screen, and like solar power backup and everything, then we wouldn't have been able to afford that. Good leadership, I think we stayed on task. and also our personal coach helped us along the way, We never were pushed for time, or sat around doing nothing, so I think we worked great as a team. We needed more Play Doh colours. The computer programmes are good. Yeah well I guess we really it we bounced off of each other,
So we need to tally up how much our w our product will be costing. we're using a regular chip., it's cur it's double curved, so its curved all around., we're using plastic and rubber, So it's like special colour well we'll have two colours Well one colour for the case, one colour for the buttons. So our operating cost is twelve twenty Euros.
Fantastic. Thank you very much.
we're using a regular chip.
, it's cur it's double curved, so its curved all around.
and we're thinking to carry-on with the fruit and vegetable theme, the colour combination just could just be named after different fruit, But we're thinking that, seeing as we're having it in interchangeable casing anyway, like banana could be black and yellow, watermelon red and green,
So it's like special colour well we'll have two colours
, we're using plastic and rubber,
And we have the company logo here It's in the middle of one of the little R_s. And then the other one is the power. So it's palm-held. buttons are accessible from your thumb.
It's a pretty simple design. It's based on a mango?
Evaluation criteria is next in line., we're gonna be doing an evaluation report together based on the protoptype that we've just seen. and looking looking back at my notes from our both our conceptual and our functional meetings, I made a list of what our original requirements and goals were, and we're gonna do it on a one to seven scale where one is true and seven is false. So basically the lower p the lower the points the better.
And this is just if you've got like eleven or twelve or thirt the plus. So one plus one would be eleven, You press a plus button? I've never heard of that kind before. but if if I wanna go to say number like sixty five, channel sixty five, if I press the six it'll go to channel six, and then I'll press the plus, and then it'll go to six and then put the five and it'll go to sixty five? we can further define that. I wouldn't have thought it'd be a problem that it went to channel six first, in like on the way to channel sixty five. like as long as we realise that's what it'll do. Well the there is a there's a delay on remotes I think. we went for like a a circular design for the numbers because we thought that's kind of a more natural movement than just going like that with your thumb. Okay, as for the colours, we were presented with a limited range of colours for this prototype. that this is not necessarily a representation of the true colours that we would necessarily use. and we're thinking to carry-on with the fruit and vegetable theme, the colour combination just could just be named after different fruit, But we're thinking that, seeing as we're having it in interchangeable casing anyway, like banana could be black and yellow, watermelon red and green, Banana's more representative of our colour scheme, like the company the yellow and black. or vanilla might be the most popular if it just blends in
the agenda for this meeting is we'll initially have the prototype presentation by our two designers. And then we will evaluate it, given the criteria that that we gave gave it. And talk about our finances, whether we were under or over our budget.
so then we forget the ball.
Do you guys have any ideas for what it should look like? We want it to be a b a ball, I could draw sorta the ball idea. this is where it's connected together, and then when you open it out, it could fol it could be maybe flip, like a flip phone, Maybe a hinge that'll have to be the strongest part of it. the ball is a nice idea because of it's stability really, Also also you risk the hinges here. That's that's a problem. so we'd have to have it flat on one side at least, down here somewhere, but that's of course a weak point, yeah. I mean would we just have a flat spot on the bottom of the ball? The shape is perhaps not the most ideal. there must be a compromise between stability and design here, so. I can't think of anything other than a long rectangle for remote, it's not innovative, everybody does long remote My idea was just to have it be kind of like a keyboard type shape, you know, like video games We could also try to do the hinge thing, so it could like flip out that way. but something that would maybe fit in the hand easier. I mean maybe design something, that's sort of like So perhaps the the joystick the the keyboard idea might work better. Because even I suppose even with the ball it still not the ho easiest thing to hold, yeah. I think it's definitely got to be a a one-handed a one-handed job. if it's small it probably looks better, may not be th as functional. say we went with the ball the ball function, but maybe we give it sort of grips along the side s to make it easier to hold on to. But if we're gonna make it flat on the bottom, then that eliminates our ball anyways. And then we have the problem with the hinge. The question is also, I dunno, d do you really always want to open that thing when you have to use it
Generally, all remotes are sort of quite similar in their appearance. Do we want something crazy? we want something new that's gonna stand out. Maybe sorta spherical or something. A ball. We want it to be a b a ball, I can't think of anything other than a long rectangle for remote, it's not innovative, everybody does long remote keyboard type shape, you know, like video games Because even I suppose even with the ball it still not the ho easiest thing to hold, yeah. So perhaps the the joystick the the keyboard idea might work better. But if we're gonna make it flat on the bottom, then that eliminates our ball anyways. so then we forget the ball. So we've got our sort of keyboard kind.
marketing, you could s find out what is the most universally appealing remote control out there.
and then when you open it out, it could fol it could be maybe flip, like a flip phone, Maybe a hinge that'll have to be the strongest part of it. Also also you risk the hinges here. That's that's a problem. but that's of course a weak point, yeah. And then we have the problem with the hinge. The question is also, I dunno, d do you really always want to open that thing when you have to use it?
And then marketing will look and see what what people want.
however one question is how stable is that thing supposed to be, because of it's stability really, the ball is a nice idea so we'd have to have it flat on one side at least, down here somewhere, I mean would we just have a flat spot on the bottom of the ball? there must be a compromise between stability and design here, so.
It's something that we're supposed to sell for about twenty five Euros
as you all know we're here to create a brand new fantastic remote. I'm Nick Debusk, I'm the Project Manager. we'll just get started with everyone kind of letting each other know who they are and what you're doing, what your what your role is. I am Corinne Whiting and I will be the Marketing Expert In the function design phase I will be talking about user requirement specification, In the conceptual design phase I will be dealing with trend watching And then finally in the detailed design phase I will be doing product evaluation, I'm Ryan. I'm the User Interface Designer. likewise I've three different roles for each stage of design. the functional design is looking at the tex technical functions of a remote control. in the concept design, the user interface, And the detailed design sort of like the user interface design, I'm Manuel and I'm the Industrial Designer in in this project. In the functional design phase I'm I'll be dealing mostly with the requirements, we'll discuss what the prog what functions the the product has to fulfil and so and so on. in the conceptual design I'll be pro mostly dealing with properties and materials of our product. And the detailed design in the detailed design I'll be concerned with the look and feel of the product itself,
our our agenda is the opening, acquaintance which we've kinda done. tool training, project plan discussion and then closing. we are putting together a new remote control. we want it to be something original. of course we're a not only a electronics company but a fashion conscious electronics company, so we want it to be trendy and we want it to be easy to use. we've got the functional design, conceptual design and detailed design
let's just throw out some ideas of what kind of remote control we want to have, and then we can go into how we're gonna design it function of remote control is just just change channels is its main function. we want it to be a T_V_ remote or I I mean do we want it to to do other things besides just be a a television remote? I suppose you c try make it a universal remote But, you know, they all sorta have the same role changing channels, volumes and then programming. I think they all work on the same prin principle as well one thing I thought of with the remote control is you always lose 'em. So if there's a g a way of finding it quite easily, I thought that'd be quite good quite a good feature. So we should we should set our remote control up to where it has a like a tracking device you could whistle or make a noise there's a button on the T_V_ that you press and it'd beep. Generally, all remotes are sort of quite similar in their appearance. so they're kinda like long and rectangular. Do we want something crazy? we want something new that's gonna stand out. Maybe sorta spherical or something. A ball. Maybe like user-friendly, where you can use both hands, like a little keyboard type thing. I thought maybe, because people always tend to throw a remote control about the place to one another and maybe the actual controls are inside or something. you can't have it be any form and fulfil all functions at the same time, so there are always the some restrictions however one question is how stable is that thing supposed to be, How sturdy is it gonna be? we want it to to hold up to somebody's child, you know, throwing it across the room so ball-shaped, you know, if it were ball-shaped maybe, It could be cased on the outside and t everything could be inside. we want it to be modern, fun, sturdy,
It's something that we're supposed to sell for about twenty five Euros goals for profits are I think somewhere around fifty million Euros, what they wanna make on it, so. Also since we're partners of the International Remote Control Association, maybe we wanna make it something that would globally appeal. marketing, you could s find out what is the most universally appealing remote control out there. And maybe as far as design goes, maybe we could have different ones for different target audiences, I think, sometimes remotes have too many buttons, so maybe as simple as possible, as few buttons inside as possible. if it had like if some kind of like light or something or lights around it.
the company wants us to incorporate the corporate colour and our slogan,
we want something that's simple. User interface concept, we want it to be something simple.
the remote's only gonna be for the television,
no teletext.
And Ryan you work on how how well they'll work with the us with the user. So both of those concepts.
you're watching trends
let's explore the the possibility of having the two-piece. So one for the the quick zapping and possibly one you know with just that rounded part that fits into your hand.
the last meeting we went over who was responsible for what. I'm responsible for leading the meetings, keeping the notes, and coming up with the final presentation. Corinne is our Marketing Expert. Ryan is our User Interface Designer. And Manuel is the Industrial Designer. we decided our remote, we want it to be a universal remote we want to be modern, fun, different. it needs to be sturdy, easy to find, so we gonna have that locator function. and we want to be different. and then we went over a couple of different ideas. Ball-shaped phone. The keyboard shape. we decided that it should probably be one-handed. Something we could use with one hand.
as far as speech recognition goes, the younger group looks like they're all for it. From the fifteen to twenty five age group over ninety percent said they would pay more. And it kind of just went down incrementally. so maybe we could discuss this and decide if we think it's worth investing in this. At least if we're targeting the younger groups.
Having just listened to what Corinne just said, I'll draw on some of the things as well. Some things that sort of relevant to what I wanna say. I'm just gonna yeah approach the technical functions design. the method I used was to explore the technical functions of a remote control. And t s simplest approach that I came to is is to change, programme and operate an electronic device remotely. I had some things sent to me. Not very much. To look at similar devices. we discussed a universal one. But I think a universal remote control is actually quite a difficult object to design, and po possibly within maybe the budget that we do it, because you'd need to know all the spef specifications of a all the like electronic companies. You have to set them, reset them to everything. and that would only add buttons. Whereas I think the aim is to take away buttons. So I think it'd be better maybe to concentrate on maybe just a universal one for T_V_s. here here's just two pictures of remote controls. But one is user-centred. And you can straight away see there's less buttons. And the other one is engineer-centred where that's more specified for the sort of the elaborate piece of equipment it's trying to control and on what the have said and the market research and stuff probably looking at something that should be user-centred. Fewer buttons, simpler to use, maybe the other fifty percent, the buttons that are used very rarely like programming, they could be hidden maybe some remote controls you might have come across have maybe a little flip thi thing where they're hidden away. the major findings market researchers have said, it's the image and the appearance that people di dislike. So that we should concentrate on something that would set a trend. our product I think should be user interface orientated. Like I said to concentrate on T_V_ remote control,
this is my report, which is going to be based pretty much on a survey first of all, the method that I used was by doing some marketing research, by doing research on some interviews that were conducted. And then some internet research. I think there were a hundred remote users that they interviewed. And so I will show you some of the results from that, They said that the users dislike the look and feel of their current remote controls. And seventy five percent of the users find their remote controls to be ugly. And eighty percent of the users would be willing to spend more money if they could get a remote that would look fancy. I think that's definitely important. Seventy five percent of users said they zap a lot. And if anyone could clarify what that means? Zap, does that just mean like changing the channel? and fifty percent of the users say that they're only using ten percent of the buttons on their remote control. they kept track of the frequency per hour in using certain buttons. And some of them it looks like barely need to be included at all. Of course channel selection is used the most frequently. And then teletext was the next. Volume and then power. And then audio settings and screen settings and channel settings were practically never used. I think we could definitely eliminate or somehow combine a lot of the functions into one button. the biggest user frustrations, as we said fifty percent of people find that their remotes are lost somewhere, and so I think a tracking device of some sort would be a good idea. thirty four percent said it takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote. And twenty six percent said that the controls are bad for R_S_I_. as far as speech recognition goes, the younger group looks like they're all for it. From the fifteen to twenty five age group over ninety percent said they would pay more. And it kind of just went down incrementally. so maybe we could
They said that the users dislike the look and feel of their current remote controls. And seventy five percent of the users find their remote controls to be ugly. And eighty percent of the users would be willing to spend more money if they could get a remote that would look fancy. I think that's definitely important. Seventy five percent of users said they zap a lot. And if anyone could clarify what that means? Zap, does that just mean like changing the channel? and fifty percent of the users say that they're only using ten percent of the buttons on their remote control.

And twenty six percent said that the controls are bad for R_S_I_.
from all all three of your presentations, I think that we were on the right track a lot in our last meeting. We want something that looks good. we want something that's simple. We want something that you can find easily. And the speech recognition I I guess is kind of give or take. probably, I would say, probably not worth the investment at this point in time. I did have have a thought about the sort of the tracking thing. if it came with maybe a holder or holster, whatever you wanna call it. But if you don't put it back in, you press something like a little button on that, and that just sort of sends out a beep to find where it is or something. Just by infrared. That'd be, that'd be good if we were going with our our ball. Or or with you know I guess with any form that that would be good. that could be the charger. we could use rechargeable batteries in the remote. However, however you wanted to go about it, the holder could also be the charging unit. With the locator button. It looks like you're already on your way for working with the components. User interface concept, we want it to be something simple. Minimal number of buttons. I do still think it needs to be something that is ultimately one-handed. The ball is probably not a good idea. Shall we maybe shoot for a a specific target group? if we were shooting for young guys then it's a certain look to the remote. Or girls or older people? I don't know if that might cope with like the trend-watching. but maybe by the next meeting we'll have some info on that. we'll just say we've got a colour scheme for it. yellow it's nice and bright, with the buttons being grey or black. And our slogan pasted somewhere on it, on the the bottom maybe we could flare it or something. of course this will look like a bone then. it might be to look at sort of the
Manuel you're going to work on the components for for what we're gonna use.
Gonna talk to you about the working design of the interiors basically which is what dictates the design the both the interface basically and the outer appearance I'm going to do a lot of the stuff on the board. This is the basic basic premise of a remote control. the basic function is to send messages to another system. An energy source feeds an integrated circuit, like a chip, there's also some sound systems but infrared is the better or the more more used system. that can compose messages. Often in the form of infrared bits. A user interface controls the chip and accordingly the messages. what we have is different components that obviously need to go in there. We'll start with an energy source. which is usually a battery This energy source of course is connected to the the user interface itself. which can be buttons, whatever, which in fact controls a chip. the way this goes normally is that this chip then controls an infrared lamp. And Of course that's controlled, the chip itself is controlled by the user interface. The way you normally normally do it is that you add a little device such as a lamp to the whole thing as well, so that you know that it's working basically. The the energy source for one thing can be altered. What we probably cannot alter is of course the infrared, the sending device basically, the infrared lamp. as we've heard speech recognition is the hype obviously in the moment. The user interface. That's something we can also discuss. We cannot change the chip Or if we just do the usual button thing. Or we have a touch pad or something like that And of course the energy source. Batteries. Solar cells. Of course it's always a question whether these these components are in fact available cheap enough, developed enough. the more complex we make it of course, the more expensive younger generations of people have said that they would pay more for a speech recognition remote. possibly it might be worth the investment. I think speech recognition
I was sent a couple of things to modify our new requirements. the remote's only gonna be for the television, which is good because we already decided no teletext. the company wants us to incorporate the corporate colour and our slogan, which is we put the fashion in electronics. And our corporate colours are grey and yellow. And we could probably get away with black too but
younger generations of people have said that they would pay more for a speech recognition remote. possibly it might be worth the investment. I think speech recognition was one of those things where they have to be really good for them to work. 'Cause sometimes you find yourself just saying things over and o if it's on your phone. And you need to sort of take into light languages and then different dialects I suppose as well. I myself I find, when you, h when there's something like spee speech recognition. Like you call on the phone and you try to change your telephone or power or something. Sometimes they have a a speech recognition on the other end, and you find yours, like you said, saying the same thing over and over and over. Another thing about these figures is ninety one percent of the youngest age groups said they'd do it, but probably a lot of them that's actually their parents money. I don't know if they would actually go out and purchase this themselves, a fifteen year old you know. It's a, it's a gimmick factor that they like at first, And the speech recognition I I guess is kind of give or take. probably, I would say, probably not worth the investment at this point in time.
causes a problem for left or right-handed people actually. So. instantly sort of always going for the right-handed person. Maybe you could buy like a special left-handed version of the remote. Special order. it should be probably designed for a right-handed p person.
I mean I'm just just thinking maybe if it was circular with the sort of that sort of the sort of early idea we had, with the way that was more like that, So one for the the quick zapping and possibly one you know with just that rounded part that fits into your hand.
I think speech recognition was one of those things where they have to be really good for them to work. 'Cause sometimes you find yourself just saying things over and o if it's on your phone. I myself I find, when you, h when there's something like spee speech recognition. Like you call on the phone and you try to change your telephone or power or something. Sometimes they have a a speech recognition on the other end, and you find yours, like you said, saying the same thing over and over and over.
you've got volume, up and down. I guess you've got you know one through nine. For typing in your channels. Channel up and down. Power. a mute. A menu button, maybe.
Talking of which maybe a scrolling function is not not too bad. Would probably be like a scrolling, little scrolling wheel like this. Like a wheel on your mouse.
yellow it's nice and bright, with the buttons being grey or black.
And our slogan pasted somewhere on it, on the the bottom
Minimal number of buttons.
We want something that looks good.
We want something that you can find easily.
Manuel you'll be working on the look-and-feel design.
Ryan you'll be working on the user interface design.
Corrine we'll want a product evaluation.
So is the two piece idea out? Well we sort of rid of that because gonna use a battery. Well we can still design a two-piece remote without having a base, having one of them be a base station, Energy source I think we've, I think we've decided batteries, although not exciting, are probably our best bet. Okay when it comes to the chip-on-print, as I said, the the more advanced features you want, the fancier the chip has to be and the more expensive. So I guess the case would be plastic, with Perhaps that's not even enough rubber to qualify as being part of it. It's more of a su it's more of a supplement maybe. So then for the scroll, are we going for the iPod type? Which will require a more expensive chip-on-print right?
And you know you just p stick on just sort of rubber things that that sort of grip the thumb bit. Is that an option, a plastic shell with a rubbery coating on at certain spots? How about affecting the surface of the actual remote control? Say we don't make it p a particular fruit shape obviously, but give it like the surface of an orange, banana, whatever.
The details of the components' design, as you can see there, what we have is the board, main board of the remote control. top left side you can see the chip, which is the, what we were talking about, this was is the device to recognise the signals the input, Its job is to wait for you to press a key, then to translate that key press into infrared light signals, that are received by the television. we are talking this this the simple and cheapest version at the same time. We are talking something more complicated of course, it's going to be more expensive as well. we are also restricted in the use of our outer shell, or in the material that we could use for our outer shell. So we what we can use is plastic, rubber, wood and titanium. Can also mix these. what we could use is, or what I was offered, or what we could use, is a basic bateer battery. So obviously I personally have to say that dynamo is out of the question really. solar cell is interesting. May fail though, every here and there. the kinetic energy thing might work, but the same problem. You leave it lying around and you first have to shake it before it it starts to work. So I'd say what we're stuck with really is the basic battery. our interface options are push-buttons. however when it comes to the scroll wheel of the iPod I've one big objection and that is that we have to fit an L_C_D_ into the remote control as well. If we have a more sophistic sophisticated scroll wheel rather than this very basic set-up that we that I've just presented, the chip has to be more s more sophisticated and thus more expensive as well. solar cells cannot be used on a curved or latex surface or remote control. With the titanium we cannot make it a curved design. With plastic, as I understand it, you can use any form. With rubber we could sh pretty much shape it the way we
So I guess the case would be plastic, with Perhaps that's not even enough rubber to qualify as being part of it. It's more of a su it's more of a supplement maybe.
So, then I had a look at new products that are on the market. this is the voice, there is a voice recognition remote control, which can control mus multiple devices. And then on the right is obviously an iPod, and all that is is just a a nice big scroll menu that y you sort of go through. And nothing's simpler really. then there's things like this, which is a a a kid's remote, where the the parents have the facility to control and program what children can watch before. So I don't know if there's a possibility of having one remote contr you know like we just had two components, Maybe we've so suggested this two-part thing, where if it was to have a speech recognition thing, And then just have the simple sort of hand-held thing that we sort of devised earlier, as the actual remote. it could be a graphical display, the actual remote contr the actual control port maybe could have like an iPod where you just sort of control through the menus.
So then for the scroll, are we going for the iPod type? Yeah I think so. Which will require a more expensive chip-on-print right?
I was sent some information from the company saying that they, the technology department have devised a new speech recognition technology, where you can program questions into such devices. They gave an example of a coffee machine where you program a question, you program the answer, and the machine responds accordingly. There's different ways of a user can use products l like a remote. there's a graphical use, where you you look at pictures and well on a screen. A command line where you obviously type things in, and you get a response. and then it ju that's just to point out the sort of inconsistent u sort of use of interface in remotes.
And the two of you get to play with the modelling components and maybe and and get us a prototype. basically just be working on the prototype, we'll accomplish your other two actions.
We need to keep it simple, have limited buttons, But I think that, even if it's very subtle, we need to kind of trick our consumers, so they at least get the idea that they're getting something that's new and modern and sleek and We brought up the idea of having two pieces, which we could discuss further. we need to incorporate this fashion trend of fruits and vegetables. Possibly like a cover like they have for mobile phones? Personalise your remote.
So I'd say what we're stuck with really is the basic battery. Energy source I think we've, I think we've decided batteries, although not exciting, are probably our best bet.
I was given a brief executive summary, and then an update on some recent fashion trends that we might like to look at. okay the most important finding was that the fancy look-and-feel seems to be twice as important to the users as the current functional look-and-feel design, the second most important finding was that the remote should be technologically innovative. And thirdly the remote would be easy to use. And again these are all things we've kind of already come up with on our own, but this just backs it up. As far as fashion update, we've learned that fruits and vegetables will be the most important theme for cloths, shoes and furniture. and also, as opposed to last year, this year the material is expected to be spongy in feel.
I'll just take a few minutes and go through the previous minutes. we decided that, or we know that we need to use company colours, company logo. our Marketing Expert gave us some i information from interviews with a hundred different remote users. with some statistics that backed basically what we were thinking before. which were all things we were thinking we would wanna make it simple. And that it should look different than what's out there. I think we decided that the expense was not necessarily worth it, and that we didn't wanna go with a universal remote, because increasing cost and increasing complexity. I believe then we came up with a couple of ideas for what we think the design of the remote will be. something that will fit into easily into someone's hand. And with a scrolling function also.
Okay when it comes to the chip-on-print, as I said, the the more advanced features you want, the fancier the chip has to be and the more expensive. Which will require a more expensive chip-on-print right?
Is that an option, a plastic shell with a rubbery coating on at certain spots? And you know you just p stick on just sort of rubber things that that sort of grip the thumb bit. So I guess the case would be plastic, with Perhaps that's not even enough rubber to qualify as being part of it.
And you know you just p stick on just sort of rubber things that that sort of grip the thumb bit. Is that an option, a plastic shell with a rubbery coating on at certain spots?
I mean I guess the two options are if we had our remote in the shape of a fruit or vegetable. Or with exterior designs. So maybe we could have something that's somewhat removable, Is that an option, a plastic shell with a rubbery coating on at certain spots? I would say, if I were to make a decision, I would probably put the fruit aspect at the lower lower end of the spectrum of of importance. I think having a shape could be a little ridiculous, How about affecting the surface of the actual remote control? Say we don't make it p a particular fruit shape obviously, an orange, banana, whatever. but give it like the surface of
I think that perhaps the project evaluation's just supposed to be completed by me. But I'd like to hear your thoughts. h what did you think of our project process? yeah I think we did quite well. Our leadership was quite weak in the beginning. But as the day went along we had more idea of what we were doing. and I think it was interesting as you guys brought up more information and studies that we were right on with a lot of those things. Super super. I had some problem with the pen I think, Minus your PowerPoint fiasco.
So our total is fifteen point five. by three Euros over. you could maybe take out the L_C_D_ dis display even, Right. We may not need it.
It's very intuitive, I think yeah. 'Cause we've we've brought it down to basically four controls most common, which are channel and volume. So that's a one. Something that big and that yellow you just don't lose anymore. But if we were to, if we were, that, the speech recognition. That, we could maybe just use that solely for the the finding thing. Y you could add an extra feature actually. Which makes this thing raise hell when you remove it too far from the television. That can't cost much. Let's add one of those features and say yes. Two.
I think it's definitely different than anything else out there. I'd say, when it comes to the ergonomics, the form and stuff, yes that's definitely more beautiful than your average. So to answer that honestly I would rather say like, we have not solved the problem completely with the ugly remote because the colour is ugly, definitely. I mean I much prefer something like brushed chrome with that form. Four is fair.
Now we get to do the budget numbers. We want a fifty percent profit on this. and how many batteries do we think this will probably take? Two. That's the advanced chip-on-print, yeah. 'Kay then the case is a Probably it's double curved. Case materials are Plastic. That's not a special colour. It's a specially ugly colour, but it's not special. Well we only have one button so really we shouldn't be charged, we shouldn't be charged anything for the the button supplements.
It's all just stolen technology when it comes down to I don't know that we are that innovative, to tell you the truth. I would say we're probably at four. We have some spongy, yeah. It's not a one though. Probably a four at most. I'd say we did. Well the recent fashion is rather displayed in the in the L_C_D_ and the way you operate it than the form and the colour,
This is our last meeting. I'll go ahead and go through the minutes from the previous meeting. and then we'll have a, the prototype presentation. Then we'll go through the finance and see if we fall within the budget. then we'll do the evaluation, and then we can finish up after that with any changes that we'll need to make, We had the fashion trends that people want a fancy look-and-feel. they liked fruit and vegetables in the new styles. and a spongy feel. they wanted limited buttons and simplicity. the iPod, we really liked the look of that. the materials for the case, the different energy sources, the different types of chips, and made a decision on what we were going to use to make our remote.
Two.
Which makes this thing raise hell when you remove it too far from the television. Let's add one of those features and say yes.
You guys are gonna help me do an evaluation of the criteria. we're gonna be doing it based on a seven point scale. And one is going to mean true, that we did actually achieve that. With seven being false, we did not achieve that. So for the first one, we need to decide, did we solved the problem of the users who complained about an ugly remote? Did we make it simple for new users?, do the controls now match the operating behaviour of the users? How about the problem of a remote being easily lost? Are we technologically innovative? spongy material? did we put the fashion in electronics? Now we just gotta calculate. Okay we'll say two point four two.
'Kay then the case is a Probably it's double curved.
basically we we st went with the colour yellow. working on the principle of a fruit which was mentioned, it's basically designed around a banana. These would be like the rubber, the rubber grips. but all the controlling would be done with this scroll wheel. And the the simplest functions would be almost identical to an iPod, And then to access the more complicated functions you'd you sorta go, you press that and go through the menus. we could use the voice. It's as simple as you, we could make it really. Plastic covered with rubber. T the actual thing might be smaller. It's a quick on-off button.
That's the advanced chip-on-print, yeah.
by three Euros over. So our total is fifteen point five. What if we completely took out the the one single button we've got on. I suppose the L_C_D_ C_ display's the one that's pushing it up a bit though. you could maybe take out the L_C_D_ dis display even,
Well we only have one button so really we shouldn't be charged, we shouldn't be charged anything for the the button supplements.
That's not a special colour. It's a specially ugly colour, but it's not special.
Case materials are Plastic.
But if we were to, if we were, that, the speech recognition. That, we could maybe just use that solely for the the finding thing. Y you could add an extra feature actually. Which makes this thing raise hell when you remove it too far from the television. That can't cost much. Let's add one of those features and say yes.
Right. We may not need it.
Welcome at at the kick off meeting of our latest project. w we will try to structure this meeting with an a with an agenda as presented here. after the opening we will tr get acquainted to each other. See what our roles are in this project. We have been provided with some w technical tools to to communicate and to well, learn from each other's plans w we will also try to to get acquainted to this tools then we will come to the to the to the actual project plan. You all know I hope how it's about the new r remote control we are going going to design. then we will discuss and wh what what our new product should look lite like.
basically this is about a a new c remote control. When you design a new product you of you of course want it to be original. we want to be distinguished, So it needs to be trendy. People want to when they look at the shelf want to think, well that's the product I I need. But then,, it also should work user friendly
the general outline of new project will be we first go through a functional design phase. You all get certain task in this in this phase and then we will meet again and discuss this functional design. And the same holds for the ph two phases after this, the conceptual design and after that a a more detailed design in which the the final project should get its definite shape.
but first we will do some tool training. and we have here a a a a white-board. I've read it from my from some colleague that it should work with some kind of toolbar. I didn't find out yet how it work, Under documents in the shared folder. I I I'm not fully updated about this shared folder. I guess we'll have a shared folder with documents that we can share. now we will try out the white-board we have here. Each of us is going. I I'm not really sure how this works, but shall I start? I think for us it's just like a normal whiteboard, but they'll be recording what we write down. Maybe maybe Anna, maybe you can start. Why don't you draw your favourite animal on on th on the white-board. it's a dog. It's a horse. A blue and black zebra. That's that's definitely a cat. it's a shark,
Let's continue to to the real stuff. our project finance thing. when we are and when w you are going to design w we must keep in mind that the selling price of the product will be about twenty five Euros, more interesting for our company of course, p profit aim, about fifty million Euro. to get at a international market also important for you all is the the product production cost must be maximal twelve twelve Euro and fifty cents. They have to sell at least four million to make a profit I think w when we are working on the international market, in principle it has enough customers And now just let have some discussion about what is a good remote control and well keep in mind this this first point, it has to be original, it has to be trendy, it has to be user friendly., maybe someone can mention some additional prerequisites for a good remote control. Of course it should have a on off button. i it should have the the the the expected functionality of a remote control. We are targ targeting the television set. You need to browse the browse the channels in upward downward way, you need to record the channels.
Of course it should have a on off button. You need to browse the browse the channels in upward downward way, you need to record the channels.
And just before starting the detailed discussion, maybe we are the marketing guy? Or I'm marketing. And you are in the u use user interface design. And I I'm the the industrial designer I'm Matthew. You know. Mael. Anna. A and I'm Nanne. Are there some other very important things to to do well, the browse function, as you m mentioned. And, you'd need the usual ones, like the changing the volume, changing the the channel
Today we have teletext and all those things. Tomorrow you might have a some more functions For example personal video recorder and all those stuffs are coming up. But we can't really design for something that hasn't been invented yet. w y you two should should, I think, think this over w espec what, what functionality. and first before designing the func thinking about the functionalities, we need to know what are the user requirements. But Ninety percent of the time, ninety nine percent of the time, people will be using the main functions, the volume, the different channels, we can have all the fancy things as well but the main controls need to be very obvious and very easy to use.. Keep k keep in mind i it's a it's a twenty five Euro unit, so the the very fancy stuff w we can leave that out, I think. twenty five Euro you expect a quite, well normal but good functioning user friendly remote control. So we need some numbering buttons, some teletext things the main is browsing. Yeah. but but but ab about the spec the buttons, the buttons that will be on it. I I think we can discuss that in the in the next meeting.
when we are and when w you are going to design w we must keep in mind that the selling price of the product will be about twenty five Euros,
And you and you and well, think about requirements,
more interesting for our company of course, p profit aim, about fifty million Euro. to get at a international market
also important for you all is the the product production cost must be maximal twelve twelve Euro and fifty cents.
I would like to get this wrapped up you know now the basic the basic things. just just for the next meeting, well,, you wor yes, work on a design, I mean so w we will be still fle flexible with maybe adding some functions. you will be working on on technical function design, so And you and you and well, think about requirements, Does it need internet, or or do do we stay at basic basic television interface. and you will be informed via email and other kind of communication. next meeting will be in in thirty minutes.
and first before designing the func thinking about the functionalities, we need to know what are the user requirements.
you will be working on on technical function design, so
we we will wait for Anna, a few minutes. I think you can put anywhere you want, actually. It's not a directional mic, anyway. So I will try to get my presentation running. Can't help you with that. Alt F_ five. Doesn't appear on the screen here. It's working.
well,, you wor yes, work on a design,
Of course it should have a on off button. You need to browse the browse the channels in upward downward way, you need to record the channels. the browse function, as you m mentioned. And, you'd need the usual ones, like the changing the volume, changing the the channel
We are targ targeting the television set.
. Keep k keep in mind i it's a it's a twenty five Euro unit, so the the very fancy stuff w we can leave that out, I think. twenty five Euro you expect a quite, well normal but good functioning user friendly remote control. but but but ab about the spec the buttons, the buttons that will be on it. I I think we can discuss that in the in the next meeting.
But I don't think we're trying to make a universal remote here.. But if people are buying a new remote control for functionality they'll buy a universal remote. So your you think we should go for a more u universal high-performance We We're not building a universal remote, we're not building a high end product. If we're getting into universal remote territory, we're getting to L_C_D_ screens and things like that I don't know. I don't know whether that's necessary. then we we decide on on on going to this more universal kind of control. And basically you can look to the standards of other And if we want to get the market, we really need that. you can also browse through all the standards you know, where are the limit of standards for all of them and you can just browse through them. m maybe it is good when you try to find out which components you therefore need
so that's w we should make our our our R_C_ as trendy as possible but it should also be have a reliable image, so when it looks too too spacey or too fancy people will think well does it work at all.
first thing is teletext is a well known feature of televisions but it's it's getting used less and less.
and then with younger customers I mean people below the age of forty, but w we're targeting I think on more on the on the twenty to forty group.
and maybe you can look on on what trends are in this in this type of market.
. But I think taking the idea of getting inspiration from mobile phones is interesting, especially if we're going after a younger market, that's the the the the new and the funky things, for example you have presently keys like one, two, three like this, actually, and four five six like that and you can have keys like this in form like keys like that there's lot there's lots of pretty mobile phones, 'Cause we haven't talked about demographic at all How much longer have we got for the meeting by the way? you you you can have keys like which are which are like so. so we basically don't change the original order of them so the keys can be it looks you know not very much cluttered we should now try to decide on our target group., basically we're trying to get people to buy a remote control wouldn't they already have a remote control with their television when they buy one? So our our our remote control has to be better. 'cause it's only a low market, it's a cheap-end remote control, we might we'll be able to beat them on th the look of it, th the design of it they're not just going to buy a new remote control just 'cause it looks pretty, they have to actually need it as well. I think many people said in your in in your research the appearance of the R_C_ is is important when they are buying one. But if people are buying a new remote control for functionality they'll buy a universal remote. I've got friends who've got so many things they need a universal remote, So your you think we should go for a more u universal high-performance We We're not building a universal remote, we're not building a high end product. we have yeah twelve point five Euros per per R_ s R_C_ now you know that chips are very cheaps and we can include it in our control some new new features. If we're getting into universal remote territory, we're getting to L_C_D_ screens
and y you will try to get more specific user interface content
m maybe it is good when you try to find out which components you therefore need
m maybe it is good when you try to find out which components you therefore need and y you will try to get more specific user interface content and maybe you can look on on what trends are in this in this type of market. and we'll I'm sure we'll up something good we we can have lunch now. after lunch you have we have thirty minutes of work and then we have the next meeting. But you will be informed via the computer.
you have a standard T_V_ remote where you have just a on, off button and play, volume change and keys for the number and more than one digit option. And if you see for example righ right now even the one on more than one digit option is for two digit channel which is like ninety nine, but tomorrow you might have one fifty channels you know to browse or two hundred channels to browse who knows, this is the standard one with without any fancy thing like i it doesn't have teletext option,
I'm going to talk a little bit about the technical function so wha what actually it's about what is the user going to do, basically the idea is to send a message to the T_V_ set, and usually we it is easier to have keys or buttons and then changing a button will basically change the message which is being sent to the T_V_ as Anna has said that this ki people are interested in things which are you don't need to k press the keys, people are can have a speech recognition but this is s a question which will we have to see later. there are two kinds of remote if you popularly in the household, And then you have what's the v video remote file usually it has almost all the keys over there but it then it has other options like stop and then you play the movie or or fo fast forward the movie or something like that so i it has those
I have received some some some some well points of of thinking over of my account manager first thing is teletext is a well known feature of televisions but it's it's getting used less and less. That's that's especially because of the internet of course. Do we include it, and do we give it a prominent prominent place on on on the on well on the remote mot control itself. further yes we must think, do we stay to to television only, the television as we as we all know it with with broadcasting signals and you can't go back or do we go further as Matthew indicated by supporting recording devices?, furthermore,, w we need really need to interest y younger customers and then with younger customers I mean people below the age of forty, and our our current customers are mainly forty plus younger people like trendy trendy designs, so that's w we should make our our our R_C_ as trendy as possible but it should also be have a reliable image, so when it looks too too spacey or too fancy people will think well does it work at all.
personal preferences I would basically think of having a kind of aim for the next generation thing where the we could have both the the f a T_V_ and the remote video remote control because some of the keys in the video's remote control and the T_V_ they could be integrated together How would that work? so is it gonna be like a switch on the remote that says t use the T_V_ or use the V_C_R_? you can have a key which could tell y it could go to the video thing in that case when it you use that the function should be able to take up the V_C_R_ option in in few ye coming years you might even have a system where you have a separate sitting setup box suppose you are not able to watch some programme and actually it downloading all the time for you when you come back you could just switch on that thing and watch a program. In that case you want to browse faster, browse slow, you want to have those kind of functionalities. These are kind of next generation functionalities. I mean the hard disk recorders I I've seen them in the shop. and you and you you need basically the functionalities what you need in both video as well as in the standard T_V_ thing. But I don't think we're trying to make a universal remote here. W w w w we need to decide on on on on in how far we go to in this. for example the presently the video market actually this demand, video over-demand or what we call it as, it's presently booming up actually you want to watch a movie and your p your provider gives a list of movies, and then you select those list.
Yes yes maybe maybe you can can just talk about it or maybe you can use the whiteboard if necessary. I've just been presented with some research we've done in a small focus group a hundred people, just asked them about their remote control usage habits and what they want in a remote control.. I've just got a web page with some data on it. basically it's saying that users generally dislike the look and feel of their remote controls. seventy five u seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly.. Eighty percent of users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy.. Current remote controls do not match well the operating behaviour of the user. seventy five percent of users said they zap a lot,. Fifty percent of users say that they only use ten percent of the buttons, so they've got a remote control with a lot of functionality but really most of the time they only use a small part of that. Do you Do you have this information on the web page you said? I have an a web page yes. mayb maybe you can can send an email to me later. about this. there's a breakdown of how much they use the different functions on a rem remote control., power and volume selection are only used a few times within this per hour., channel selection is used a hundred and sixty eight times and then there's things like channel settings, audio settings, which are only used very infrequently.. Teletext is used fourteen times in the hour, so it is used but not nearly as much as the channel selection is used.. An interesting thing that this report has brought up is that fifty fifty percent of users report that the remote control gets lost a lot of the time in the room, so some way of some way of locating the remote control would be very useful to a lot of users.. Thirty four percent said it takes too long to learn to use a remote control, they want something that's
I will present here agenda with with with with slides to you. first just to mention I will take notes of this meeting I've also made notes of the previous meeting and I was about to send them you but then I had to go to this meeting So y you are the secretary also. Yes. Indeed. Then I hope you all have worked out some some some some presentations about about well you the the task given to you in the previous meeting.. W We will in a minute we will start with them. then I will bring in some some some new requirements I try to work them out, they were quite abstract, and we can have maybe have com some discussion about it. about the functions in this meeting we should really try to reach a decision about the target group and the functionality of the You mean the social target group who we wants to target? Yes I mean well yes w who are we going to to well to sell this, And then we will close this meeting and after this meeting we'll we'll have a lunch. Anna can you c do you have a presentations? I c I can talk about it but I have no slides or anything.
we should agree on what are the technical functions for this remote control and I show you the the working design. my aim would be to design the and choose the chips and the infrared components to build the remote control
and we'll I'm sure we'll up something good you can also browse through all the standards you know, where are the limit of standards for all of them and you can just browse through them.
I think as everybody knows I'm the Industrial Designer. And in this presentation this group presentation is gonna focus on the working design of the the remote control. I'd like first to give a quick a very simple introduction, how does it work, the basic function of a remote control is to send messages to another system that is fixed. an energy source feeds an integrated circuit, the chip, that can compose messages, usually through a infrared bit and the user interface controls the chip and accordingly the the messages, the main point is that I would wish to to make a really functional product. I would prefer to have very functional capabilities rather than fancy stuff that in fact is not used and doesn't work. as it's important to take into account the user requirements from the Marketing Expert Anna we want an on off button, it's simple but it's it's important, and also the to both channels as well as other buttons that come after, the components I quickly draw here, in this part you have the remote control the the sender and on the other part the receiver my aim would be to design the and choose the chips and the infrared components to build the remote control of course we need energy sources and the receiver a a receiver. what I have found and after a lot of work actually I I draw this I draw for you this schema And that's it so I won't go into details about that but these are my preferences to use that kind of components. And and why do you want these kind of component? I mean, are they cheap, or are they reliable? and yeah th you have always a compromise with reliability and i if it's expensive, this one also really reliable that's it for the working design, What I w what I was thinking about the the the schema about the sender and the receiver, can you can you get back to it? the receiver is of course already in the television So we we must adapt
we have yeah twelve point five Euros per per R_ s R_C_ we can't, with the price range.
do maybe two designs and then cost them out and see which one is gonna fit in our budget better. wh when you make a a design ca you can next meeting you can give an quite an exact cost price. Let let's say next meeting w you produce two designs, one one one less advanced and one more advanced and with the cost price.
I suggest we start the meeting without Matthew he's obviously late for some reason. Today we will talk about conceptual design. I hope you both did some some work concerning a conceptual design. this will be the agenda for the meeting. I will take some minutes again. we will have the presentations of y of you different team members, and then try to come to decisions about the concepts you have presented. we have some forty minutes to complete this.
It needs to be something that's very different from everything else out there. It needs to stand out. It needs to be not functional like the rest of the things out there at the moment. we need to have something that looks interesting, that looks exciting, that will stand out. That was twice as i important as the next item on here which is that it has to be technologically innovative People have to then think about it and say got something there that I want. That's a really cool feature, Third on the list, and again innovative was twice as important as this last aspect, it has to be easy to use. So they have to be able to be able to look at it and have some intuitive idea of how to use it.
do you ha Anna do you have your presentation ready? I think yeah the Matthew it is it's important that Matthew yeah is here there is Matthew. this is just a presentation on the trends that we're gonna use to make the product stand out from the rest of the products out there at the moment. we have to work out a way what we can do with our product to make it stand out and make it so people wanna buy it. We basically used some focus group surveys and some research on the current design and fashion trends that are out there at the moment, The important aspects that came out were things that we've already discussed really. The most important by far was the look and feel of it.
Going back to the idea of taking inspiration from mobile phones, a lot of them have the changeable covers, so they can choose what colour the outside is. Textured feel we just talked about. So if it's part of the the changeable covers then may maybe they can choose a different texture, a spongy one or a soft one or something like that. Yeah that's a very good idea, yeah. still taking the inspiration from the mobile phone design so functionality, the way the mobile phones work, the way the keypad looks. we talked about having a way of finding a remote control if it's been lost, There are other aspects like L_C_D_ screens and speech recognition which weren't I don't think, in my personal opinion, gonna be worth the extra expense and the extra effort that will go into them. I think we're better doing something basic like this and very will be a really cool feature to put in. maybe we just, the basic idea of having your core functions big and at the top maybe, by themselves, and then th th the finer details of buttons you don't use as much either hidden away or completely separate. Yes the the the there are changeable covers, but on the other hand I I don't know whether my superiors would be so glad with it because you have to introduce a complete new l line of of supplies it would be very complicated organisational we can afford to have two or three different designs at least. I mean those covers could go for for three, five Euro.
Drawing on the fashion trends at the moment, fruit and vegetables. This is basically talking about just the the feel of it, so probably not the smell of it, but the bright colours, eye-catching, really bold designs, and a spongy feel. I had a talk to the design people about this, but having a remote that's tactile, that feels different, that would be really cool. can you repeat and be more precise about what you just said? spongy is the current thing. Spongy is the current texture, but basically there are no reports no remotes at the moment which are spongy or tactile at all, so if we make it like maybe furry or soft or something, that'll be something that sets it apart, rather than just bare plastic which they all are at the moment. going with the fruit and vegetable idea, we've got the bright colours, so makes it stand out, the oranges and the the bright yellows and the florescent colours, part of the fruit and vegetables.
I like the idea though of having speech recognition for like the n the name of a channel like B_B_C_, rather than having to remember the the number of it on the keypad. because as more and more channels come then you have more and more problems to remember the v v exact channel numbers ex exactly, There is also a speech recognition to store channel information, names, if you have a multiple functionality, say T_V_, V_C_R_ or something I say it to the T_V_ and the T_V_, and you can programme the keys if you want to, certain keys are even the channel information. In the present market I saw it that says something like they are looking for eighty word thing, eighty word, which shouldn't be th that difficult to implement, like eighty to hundred word. Basically you want you don't want to store all the channels in the remote control, you want to st store your favourite channel. Maybe ten channels, yeah at the most. I personally would look at things like having a u universal remote, instead of having unusual ones for all of them you can think of having, with multiple functionality possibly with speech recognition. I got a mail from the the coffee machine interface unit that they have integrated the s speech recognition into a into the coffee machine, and so if you say hello coffee machine, it say hi Joe, or something like that, But a coffee machine, there's not too many words they'd be using with that it's a it's a small vocabulary. so it's a limited vocabulary thing, and very isolated word and it's it is interesting, and basically storing the channel through voice or other ways of programming your keys, on the display for the browsing
then the the idea of having a remote is generally you have different keys and different structures, different forms, and they could be like buttons and they could be of a varying sizes if you want to to basically emphasize a particular key more than the other, and maybe like you can have different colours for example having the r red for the on off switching on and off the button. So what I have found was that currently the they are mostly that the T_V_, V_C_R_, music system operated ones actually, for example if you want to follow the V_C_R_ and if you want to follow the g s some soundtrack on the w w see they have the common thing actually you can have like the remote with L_C_D_ display for browsing because you have multiple functionalities for example you are watching a movie, and you are having a universal remote control and you want to you don't know really which functionality is now, for example I can use a simple toggle switch, and a display, so I press it so the display says, okay, I'm in T_V_ or D_V_D_ or whatever it is, instead of having three keys separately for four keys, there can be children friendly where you can programme your remote so that they they are not allowed to browse certain channels which you can block them, and you can operate them. and maybe having something like a blinking thing, like it could indicate you're it it could indicate what is cal like the whether you you have enough battery in your in your remote, the blinking. At the same time, if it's a dark room, it can be used to locate the remote also y you want to let the user to programming the keys? Some of them? Yeah you can let them to do that. And isn't that too difficult I don't know if we still want the R_C_ to be easy to use, it d depends on the easiness like the user how much effort he can put. You can have it so
what I'm gonna present here is very yeah basic knowledge about the all the the components that are inside a a R_C_ a remote control, and how is it manufactured h what is the process, just to explain you. there is a a set of components in a in a remote control the the components in themself do not cost a lot there are two different types of Two different ways of using the the components for making a a remote control. the basic way is to use a an integrated circuit and some transistors with an that aims at communicating the message and to to send the message to the to the led that will transmit to the receiver. the other components and the circuit board buttons, infrared, led, etcetera, for the components just to say that the chip can detect when a key is pressed, and then it translate to the key, to a sequence, something like morse code, as you know, with a different sequence for each key, electronic parts are assembled onto printed boards because it's easier to mass produce and assemble. I think for our design we want some b programmable you know V_ V_L_S_I_ or F_P_G_A_ high technology, and also we'll use yeah like in any high-tech devices a chip of fi fibreglass to them and connect them. my personal design we need to find a solution what what is the material of the cover we want to use. If it's plastic m m maybe m maybe we can give the the the case a very normal a v very normal case but, with the changeable covers to fancy it up. So like a normal cheap plastic case which can be covered up in, for instance, a wooden case. they also emailed me that they have available a bunch of different buttons, a scroll wheels, integrated push buttons s such as a computer mouse. And very cheap L_C_D_s, so liquid crystal displays, so I'm wondering, I think we might be able to integrate L_C_D_ into our R_C_. And the final point okay is we have
Maybe it would be interesting if you could look for the cost inventories of other devices, if you're using speech recognition or something like that.
because I I'm not sure whether that that we can implement that for twelve Euro and fifty cents. I'm sorry to have Every time I have to come down on this price again so this might be a little limiting for your creativity, do we think these ideas an and my sp speech recognition, I mean maybe it's possible for for twelve Euro but then then it will be at cost of other functionality we might implement like the the the the furry case of the I would say that for programming keys, you said, it could be easily done within the the package of twel twelve Euros, i if if it's a low vocabulary it's already implemented, and w how much it's cost, maybe with a f cheap chip.
I think we might be out of time out of time for this meeting. Ju just make two designs, and the we we can decide decide between th those designs. Maybe it would be interesting if you could look for the cost inventories of other devices, if you're using speech recognition or something like that. is there anything else I need to do from a marketing point of view for the next meeting?, I don't know whether that's possible, maybe you can start evaluating their work somehow. is this me designing a way to evaluate it I don't know whether that's possible in the given time but a as far as possible. One for like cost and the one with like higher-end so that then we can be easily comparing them let's call this to an end.
you two will be together w working on a o on two prototypes
maybe you can start evaluating their work somehow.
We can give them smooth keys, The the problem most of the time we've seen, the keys is that it's small, for example, as I was if you make them big, it may change the look of the thing also to the people. and not too m too many keys of course yeah.
and further instructions will be will be sent to you by by email.
when the more expensive chip you mentioned there is is possible in the in the given budget, maybe we should go for for the more expensive chip, I don't know if it'll fit into our cost of twelve point five Euro you know. do maybe two designs and then cost them out and see which one is gonna fit in our budget better. wh when you make a a design ca you can next meeting you can give an quite an exact cost price. Let let's say next meeting w you produce two designs, one one one less advanced and one more advanced and with the cost price.
, plastic would be the material.
Double curve.
this would this would be cutting the speech recognition. and we still on fifteen, And what about the number of buttons buttons my Matthew? when we just want to to cut the number of buttons we have to make seven to to fit in in twelve twelve fifty. But that's seven basic buttons right, seven buttons without any adds-on, without special colours or form or material. So we're gonna have to scale this down to get within budget, Because sometimes whe when you watch the T_V_ in fact, you have a big display Or we could even replace them by buttons actually. I think, unless we can really drive these prices down we need to get rid of the L_C_D_ display. Okay so we can get rid of it and it's looking like we can't afford the L_C_D_ display, there's no way we can get it in there. I I think we should we should cut the L_C_D_ screen. That that's that's my opinion. So hav hav having seven buttons, instead of twelve. The speech recognition is out. Because of the budget, yeah. are we basically back to the original one now, back to the first version?
maybe you might use a A_A_ battery actually.
and we still on fifteen, We we really want a L_C_D_ other otherwise we w wouldn not get the market. So wha what what each of us think about the because it's measure point the L_C_D_, Or we could even replace them by buttons actually. Because sometimes whe when you watch the T_V_ in fact, you have a big display I think, unless we can really drive these prices down we need to get rid of the L_C_D_ display. Okay so we can get rid of it and it's looking like we can't afford the L_C_D_ display, there's no way we can get it in there. S so who thinks the the L_C_D_ disply display should be i should be in it? I th I'd like t it to be in but I can't see it happening. I can't see it fitting in. I I think we should we should cut the L_C_D_ screen. That that's that's my opinion.
for example if you add two more functionalities then better you add two more buttons, and then add a couple of buttons.
and that that now twelve Euros is the is is the price,
given speech recognition I think w you should go for the less fancy chip. I think yeah regular, today we you can do that with regular chip.
Okay so we can get rid of it I think, unless we can really drive these prices down we need to get rid of the L_C_D_ display. The speech recognition is out. Because of the budget, yeah.
and then you have a power button, which l volume, what you have, and then other than that you have channel up and down and f slow pause or s slow lo Play, pause. yeah s pause or stop, you have a L_C_D_ display, here and y this is a functional thing which can change it's a toggle switch which could change the function From D_V_D_ player to television or something. and and and then you get feedback via the L_C_D_ you can have a integrated microphone over here, This is the orange button, the microphone. you want to do a speech recognition and that channel a lot of information can be di displayed here directly on the on your on your display. And here is a small L_E_D_ which tells you like are you running out of the battery, and which is can be useful for the locating as I was talking earlier then we have a cover when you need you can use it, and this gives additional functionality but but but but i in there when this is closed, will it also cover up the L_C_D_ screen? Yeah. Actually when you are watching the T_V_, when you are watching anything or listening to them, you hardly care about what is getting displayed here, and this gives a protection to the L_C_D_ actually, giving a cover to that actually. Gives a protection It's low weight. You have to see yeah yeah the the components we put inside is very low weight. if you have new more ideas we can add new more some more keys we should stick with a number of keys it it should not be cluttering up everything. I like the shape of them, I do like the the size and the the shape.
So the the cost is actually a bit more, Sixteen Euros. So it's well outside the budget then. But the the main point we we talk about that with our manufacturer. And they say basically that the S_R_ system would be something like three Francs per item Three Euros. That's on top of the sixteen, or is it part of that? part of that, yeah. So that takes it down to thirteen Euros without the speech recognition.
the on-off button, in red. Here would be the volume. On the on the left, so you can go up and down the channels,, if you have a video or something you can forward, back. How can you change from V_C_R_ to T_V_, by the way? this is a standard T_V_ one, and then we have usually there twelve keys but we know that we rel that we have only ten digits. The extra two are for having or giving an option for having more than one channel. And the other one is for the teletext or something you want to browse through from that. Actually. It's a very basic minimal thing Exce except for the for the special shape, the surfing board, it has a quite a a conventional layout of buttons.
i i i it is a very futuristic, it's like it's like a brain machine interface and all this stuff we are thinking about in the future, it can come. Yes it really feels like like like a mobile phone. then the this is the a more a little smooth and it gives a lot of functionality, in this way, th you see there are only six keys, they are ma they are doing the job of twelve keys actually here. And so they have more space actually and it's easy to use this
Matthew is late again. it is important for him to be here. but still I think it would be in very important if the as main designer. I think we can put on the here. we will just we just have to continue. just for record I I will take notes again. first thing I was I got an email from from my superior again that we really should stay within the budget of the twelve Euro and fifty cents. when you stay in it's good, when you don't stay in you have to redesign. maybe Anna, you can have your presentation. we can't do evaluation 'til we have a design. Matthew. Nice you are here. we we designed the two items.
we we designed the two items.
Thank you. That was it. Thanks.
ma maybe then you can start now with presenting your your designs. I will start by the the basic one that fits into eight Euros actually, right, seven eight Euros, first for both they have a special shape, but it's like a surf board. And also it's not too far from a mobile. So people are used to that kind of shape, Don't take care too much about the colour Now we are supposed to give some oper offers right now.
Because, when we choose for this one we have to we have to make it more attractive and w when we to d for this one we have to make it more cheap.
w we can go back and l talk to the suppliers maybe and see if we can drive the prices down to add a few more things in but that's all we can do with the restrictions we have at the moment.
Which turns out to be on budget exactly, pretty much. With these new costings. and that that now twelve Euros is the is is the price, My m my supervisor will be glad that it's fifty cents cheaper than he expected.
Be before ta talking about the money and what's possible and what is not possible, maybe Anna you can give our give us your And maybe we run the evaluation on both of the products, both of these two. and also the evaluation criteria, so what what is important to look at. it's just a shortlist of criteria on the things that we've identified as being important to selling the product. we just go through these and rate them as a group and then at the end we'll make an evaluation based on that, These are the things we identified as being important. the three things were look and feel, innovation and ease of use, were the three important components appealing to the correct demographic so using those things in the right way to appeal to our demographic. And then goin following the company motto, following the fashion trends and putting that into the product as well. do you wanna go through and put through those on the the two products now or do we wanna discuss them further and then evaluate them? why not why not discuss discuss it now, just go through onto the whiteboard I guess. look and feel, innovation And now it easy to use. you following the idea of using the removable covers on these? w w we can still discuss that. and together with evaluating this we we might come with new ideas I've received a framework which we can do this. this is these are the the the latest prices of our production production unit for several components, so we can see whether the the price is is within the twelve Euro fifty cents. Th th this is the first design. w one's bad and seven's the best. one's true and seven's false. Look and feel. In i in my opinion purely feel is is is very good, is very good in your hand, so I I I would consider two or or may maybe even one for feel. we should also consider look, and then i it looks quite conventional. On the scale
it's easier to just make that one cheaper by just taking the speech recognition out. Because, when we choose for this one we have to we have to make it more attractive or we just have to choose. And adapt. That'll basically take us down to the budget. unfortunately we didn't see this chip, Matthew, so maybe we have to recap with this one. and w when we to d for this one we have to make it more cheap. let's let's try to to model this this phone in this sheet, Maybe we ought to reconsider everything with this, yeah. what kind of energy source It's a it's a normal battery, or maybe you might use a A_A_ battery actually. given speech recognition I think w you should go for the less fancy chip. sample speaker, yeah. Double curve., plastic would be the material. Are you talking about this or that? but they have the same shape, special colour, now we leave it to the covers. now we're either going button or L_C_D_s, L_C_D_ display. It's okay. Just say L_C_D_. So it would need twelve buttons. we might need a scroll wheel, right, for that? but for this one it's twelve Euro. So this comes to eighteen. And that's without any special button supplements. we'd have a special colour, special form and special material on all of them. it's not it's not double curved, it's single curved, it's like it's curved on the sides and curved on the top and bottom as well, that's what I thought. we've got those the scroll wheel on the side I'm I'm no I'm no I'm not sh sure. The bt buttons, we have twelve buttons, are you sure? We've got a scroll wheel for the volume this is even more than the than the cost you gave, the sixteen Euros. That is the sample sensor and sample speaker. We just need that actually. We need one. We We could go for the for the for the for the for a simple chip, but then we can't have the the speech recognition, this would
Okay so welcome everyone. So we are here for the kickoff meeting of the process of designing a new remote control. So I will first start with a warm welcome opening stuff, then we will see what will be our product and what will be the different step we will have to design it. And then we will discuss if we have few ideas and we will end by dispatching the different task you will be you will have to fulfil to complete this process. So the the goal is to have a remote control so to have an advantage over our competitors we have to be original, we have to be trendy and we have to also try to be user-friendly. So the design step will be divided in three main points. First it will be the functional design. Third is the conceptual design and then is the desired design. So the functional design is to identify the main user needs, the technical function the remote control should fulfil. And then we will move to f conceptual design where we'll specify the different component involved, what kind of user interf interface we want and what are the different trend in user interface and stuff like that. And then the desired devi design will consist in specifically implementing and detailing the choice we've made in the second point.
So I will now ask you which is very important for the design of a new remote control for to each of us to to draw your favourite animal on the white board. It's an abstract drawing of an orangutan. Of course your animal is recorded so it's not lost. It's a cat. Maybe I can draw like a very simplified cow.
So Here the financial objective of our project. That is to say to to have a production cost lower than twelve point five Euros and have a selling price of twice that price t in order to target a profe profit of fifty million Euros. Yeah if it's trendy, original I d fulfil the user needs.
Okay, so if it selled by its own i it it would rather be for multiple device. But maybe we can bulk it with already this plastic thing and the waterproof stuff as well. Maybe we can sell all that together, so so plastic protection and and a waterproof box as well.
so we have to decide for example if it can control one device or multiple. Maybe I can have the your opinion from the marketing side? if if we bundle the remote control with something to sell then it could be a single device, otherwise it could be programmable one And do you have any ideas of design ideas or any technical requirement we we should fulfil? If we don't have so many buttons could be nice. And do you have it also to be to be lighted in order to be used in the dark? Something which is not squarey maybe, not a box. So. Fit in your hand, yeah. Water-proof as well. Maybe water-proof would be very original. And, and that's one of the that's one of the shock I mean there are people that have a remote control and they are worried that it's going to break and they put some extra plastic around it. But maybe we can bulk it with already this plastic thing and the waterproof stuff as well. Maybe we can sell all that together, so so plastic protection and and a waterproof box as well. most of the time I I lose my remote control. We should have s special bu button on the T_V_ to make the remote control beeping. Maybe we can have something you whistle and the remote control beep. That's a good idea, that's very original and that's can improve. So i it's just going to add t to the cost. Yeah. We have to ask the quest of that's design to the Industrial Designer. Okay so try to find that for next meeting.
That's a good idea, that's very original and that's can improve. Yeah. We have to ask the quest of that's design to the Industrial Designer. Okay so try to find that for next meeting.

Okay so try to find that for next meeting.
So so I will ask the Industrial Designer to find out more about this industrial design so any working any working function we have discussed. So then I will ask the User Interf Interface Designer to to think about the point we discussed like the number of buttons, the the fact that is lighted or not, things like that, and what would be convenient for the user. And also I will ask the Market Expert to try to find out what are the absolute requirements, what is absolutely needed in a remote control for the user. and look at your mail because you will receive some good advice soon.
Okay so try to find that for next meeting. So so I will ask the Industrial Designer to find out more about this industrial design so any working any working function we have discussed.
So then I will ask the User Interf Interface Designer to to think about the point we discussed like the number of buttons, the the fact that is lighted or not, things like that, and what would be convenient for the user.
And also I will ask the Market Expert to try to find out what are the absolute requirements, what is absolutely needed in a remote control for the user.
in our usability lab we observed the remote control use among one hundred subjects and the subjects also filled a questionnaire seventy five per cent of users say they s zap a lot. and fifty per cents of users say they only use ten per cents of but of the buttons in the in the remote control. F not many buttons, and and u useable buttons. so they said they lost often the remote control in in the room so they want to have a way to to lot of the time they it takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote control. So they want something s really very simple and easy to use. We know that the user use a lot their remote control to to change channel. and to to change volume selection of the So as we say before, I think a remote control lightening in the dark it's it's a good thing.
So the question well first of all what to control. So most people want to have a a remote for their hi-fi and T_V_ and stuff like that. and other people also want to have remotes for controlling whole house. so there's a project I think called X_ house or something like that that does that, you can integrate your remote with computers stuff. the finder feature yeah by whistling or whatever. if you have the finder feature then you can also have at the same time as and general voice commands if you want yeah. so the user interface will consist of two parts. and th the buttons part would be a set of buttons for choosing devices, a set of buttons for special navigation in space, a set of buttons for linear access of medium and a set of buttons for random access. Like a video tape goes forward, backwards, fast and stuff yeah. For special navigation for example you might have a T_V_ in the menu and you going to change yeah? and also parameter changing. So if there are common parameters maybe we should put special buttons for that or maybe we could have everything generic Voice command w we could specify anything. We could assign any button a command to any button, if we have enough processing power,
Maybe we can include that also. Previous previous channel button. So have a wheel for incremental, have the digits on the lower side that can be closed I would say the wheel is better.
And so no speech as well because it w it would delay too much the development process Yeah. That would be cool. But eight months is really long
We have a technical problem. Otherwise, could you just describe by hand? With the the whiteboard? I dunno if you can open the Short-cut to AMI shared folder? Maybe you can send it to me by email. I will try to show it to everyone, but I think we have some technical problem or so. So I'm just going to describe briefly what we do in the remote control.
So few buttons, channel, volume control Maybe switch T_V_ on and off I discovered that when I did a quick look, they do now som they do something which is quite nice now, you have a button, you you press it, and this is the previous channel which has come back. How should they how should we implement that? This is incremental, but once you press it for a long time, you go five by five. Because you have your previous channel button if you have incremental only it's not it isn't worth it because the previous channel is eith either minus one or plus one. I mean you know there is are some with a wheel like this. Instead of having the up down buttons for you can have the wheel. not a a wheel but a ball, I would say the wheel is better. and do we put an L_C_D_ display? If you do not multi function then there is no p point in having L_C_D_. Just increase the cost. So no L_C_D_? And so no speech as well because it w it would delay too much the development process Yeah. That would be cool. But eight months is really long
If you do not multi function then there is no p point in having L_C_D_. So no L_C_D_?
but in fact we it it seems that we are going to make a T_V_ remote control according to new requirements I received from the management Because I received that email from management board and they seems to tell that that if we want to be on the market as early as possible we should focus on T_V_ more where it seems that the market is more important.
the buttons have are to be like you say resist resisting to to shocks. Eighty per cents of users would spend more money when the remote control would look fancy. so you can see that seventy five per cent of users find most remote controls ugly And remote controls are bad for R_S_I_ so you we have to make it more ergonomic yeah. for the younger it's very important To have L_C_D_ and voice. and speech recognition. And and the others is not so important
so we don't have to make a very complex remote controls to access teletext and stuff like that So anyway we don't have to include this feature because it's it's not used any more by users, And then also we have to make very clear that this this remote control is is part of of our products and show our corporate logo and and colours on the on the design as well so that they identify it as one of our product.
Basically we have a a battery a power supply here. After that we just have user interface. which could be a L_C_D_ let's say or an array of push button, something like that. Push button or a L_C_D_. After that we we feed that into an electronic chip. So I say U_C_ and I feed that to L_E_D_ which is infrared which is a an infrared component. we just have to define the processing power that we need standard standard remote control takes maybe one month to to do that. So the only time problem is the sp voice recognition. I would say about eight months to have the first results. Usually this is less tha at two dollars per chip. and what about if we design a remote control which can be configure as you want?
Well the obvious thing is a banana, I guess. Banana is also yellow so you you can't lost your remote control then. but when the banana is curving like that, with the wheel on the top and to control, You can also take into account the fact that the banana fits with the colour scheme of our company. So we will just use a a standard battery? I think it's the box that should be spongy, banana's shape.
I think p spongy is good because it it will be robust as well. I think we can keep the wheel
So we will just use a a standard battery?
So, maybe if our remote control have to be a fruit form or vegetable form And the the material is expected to be spongy. I think we can certainly just put the electronics in a spongy thing, Yeah, because it's robust. Maybe a colour that remember some fruit, things like that. Yeah. Maybe pear yeah or something like that.
And there is a fashion watchers in Paris and Milan that have detected the following trends, fruits and vegetables will be the most important theme for clothes, shoes, and furnitures. So, maybe if our remote control have to be a fruit form or vegetable form And the the material is expected to be spongy.
but when the banana is curving like that, with the wheel on the top and to control,
And in our case we just reject the buttons what we don't need and it become even simpler. We have all these buttons as you can see, but most of them, we just need the ones in the middle. With a maybe a more ergonomic design on on the bottom part. I think that the volume and the buttons that are there on the top are not very easy to reach with your thumb. you just need to put the channel numbers somewhere a bit out of the way. so we could just basically use one just wheel and user could use just the wheel to do everything with the channels in that case.
I think it's innovative to use the the wheel because I think no one else has. that's why I think we have to keep that if it's possible. but when the banana is curving like that, with the wheel on the top and to control,
So I just look at some current designs on the web, of usually more complicated remote controls. And let's look at two of them because th even though they have many buttons they look quite simple. So it's basically more or less how we would like it, with a big volume control, big channel control, and mute and power, So basically, w software we will build will look more or less the same as these two.
you just have a a very simple chip and the the user interface is just done usually by push button and in our case we are using a a wheel control. The push button are usually extremely cheap, but I just have one problem and this is related with the wheel sensor, which seems to be quite expensive. And I think we if we could just talk about that if we really need a wheel sensor or if we can not if if we could combine something with the push button. a wheel sensor is fifty time the price of a a a push button. So will will will this with including all possible things, so buttons, wheel and the chip, be lower than twelve Euros to produce? We should talk about the design of the box also which needs some money. the I I just want to mention the the problem of the the r wheels sensor which is much more expensive than any push button, We we have already some good things with with the backlight of the push button., what is the purpose of the light? You can easily find the button in the dark or so? As soon as you thought to move the the remote control you have the light. I don't think that this is really expensive, Yeah, but I expected also the wheel would be cheap but you tell me that it is very expensive so, But it can be battery consuming, no? To have the light always on? Yeah, a little bit.
Banana is also yellow so you you can't lost your remote control then. You can also take into account the fact that the banana fits with the colour scheme of our company. I think it's the box that should be spongy, banana's shape.
I think p spongy is good because it it will be robust as well. I think we can keep the wheel chip imprint we know exactly which one we are going to use.
And the cost ended to be ten point seven Euros. which is good, because we had a price gap of twelve point five Euros. for the financial aspect it's okay, we can we can continue with this product as if,
let's start with the cost aspect I look at the aspect discussed last time, that is to say to have a standard battery, to have a yellow banana shaped case with a rubber material around it to feel spongy, and also at the different aspect like having a wheel etcetera. And the cost ended to be ten point seven Euros.
fancy look and feel, what do you think? between o one and seven. I give it a I give it a five. So I think it's very very nice. it's between one and seven? Seven is the highest? Seven is the I will give a six. I will give a a five. Maybe we all have to agree on a common I don't know if you we ha we have to put one f If it's better or we can choose what we want. let's say that seven is the best. do note the grade we have five, six for me, How much would you give on the fancy aspect, on the fashionable aspect? I think six, it's a good So it will have five point five average. after, the technological aspect? we we said we have a new technological thing with a wheel. We also have the rubber material, I think I would give a five. It's four. A four also, because, except for the wheel, we don't have so much innovation. are we including the voice in the end or not?? No. Yeah, four. Four, yeah, let's put four. Very easy to use. Do you think it's easy to use? I give a seven, I think., six for me also. six point five. Is it fashion? its its f its fruit fruit shape. I would say seven. Yeah it's fashion, we can we can put a seven here. Easy to find. I think you can't miss it. I think it's cool. We have the lightning, So you'll make the material transparent so that it lights up completely, I would say seven. Is it is it robust? it's rubber, made of rubber, the only problem there might be which know, i if it's very sensitive, But it is it is surrounded by rubber material. So maybe we can put a six. Everybody is okay, six. We have to sum up everything. Six is a good if we say that seven it's it's the better,
and we are now going to see the project evaluation with our marketing expert. I made an evaluation and the the evaluation criteria is made according to the users' requirements and the market trends we talked about during the previous meetings. we have six points. we we want to have a product fancy look and feel, technologically innovative, easy to use, fashion, easy to find in a room, and robust, I have a scale of seven points. I go through all the all the points here, and according to what you think about the this project you can make a one point, two point or seven point. And after we ha we have an an average, and we see.
and when s six sit six are good it's a good p product, I think. So it's a good evaluation, I think. We have a good price So this prototype is quite nice. So having this at twenty five Euros is quite attractive, I think.
for the financial aspect it's okay, And the cost ended to be ten point seven Euros. we can we can continue with this product as if, We have a good price and so we could sell at twenty five Euros We we have the cost below our threshold The the the financial aspect were okay. and make i make profit.
we have seen the prototype. It's very nice according to the work of our two designer. The the the financial aspect were okay. We we have the cost below our threshold and so we could sell at twenty five Euros and make i make profit. The the evaluation give satisfying result as well. the cost is in the budget, the evaluation is okay, so I th I think we can now open champagne Congratulations to the team. very well, we worked together fantastically. I think it was a good collaboration.
So it's a good evaluation, I think. and when s six sit six are good it's a good p product, I think. So this prototype is quite nice. The the evaluation give satisfying result as well.
did you all receive that email? So does anyone have any overall Well what comes up for me is that if we're gonna if we're gonna be marketing a product that is going to be having no teletext, people are very comfortable with the idea of having teletext and using teletext, and so we're not we're gonna be a new product without something that people are very comfortable having right now. What are we gonna have that makes this thing better than Well tha that first point could also be an op opportunity because in seeing that teletext is becoming outdated, some sort remote control that can work with the Internet there is the opportunity that's presented, I guess. Right. Yeah. No, I I agree with you. So what I'm talking about is I see that one side we're eliminating something so we have to come up with another side which is, what are we gonna be targeting our market that identifies our product as better than because it doesn't have teletext it has ta-ta-ta-ta-ta. but but we are sort of being dictated that this should only be for the television. So we're quite fixed. So we're really probably, in terms of marketing, are looking for that's that's a cost winner rather than a fantastic new feature product. So we're gonna be removing the teletext out of any T_V_ that we people use our remote with. So it's kind of a stupid decision. we really have to innovate here I guess. 'Cause we're talking about eighty percent or ninety percent or ninety-five percent of the televisions out there are are teletext. 'cause somebody, some people are gonna be hap unhappy 'cause it took they can't ac access their teletext. It's just when we eliminate that then what do we bring? I think that the last point is probably quite straightforward. Obviously the the w it has to be branded. So then the double R_ will be our our Can you handle that black and yellow? I think w, yeah, one of the things that we should also keep in mind when
So we're quite fixed. Well what comes up for me is that if we're gonna if we're gonna be marketing a product that is going to be having no teletext, people are very comfortable with the idea of having teletext and using teletext, and so we're not we're gonna be a new product without something that people are very comfortable having right now. So we're gonna be removing the teletext out of any T_V_ that we people use our remote with. So it's kind of a stupid decision. It's just when we eliminate that then what do we bring? So I I still think if it's cheap enough functionality-wise to include, it really should be in there. and although I th I th I'm still here recommending the teletext so I'll remove that, I guess, But I t I think what the the management recommendation was less that there's a worry that teletext will become outdated rather than we shouldn't have it. But I still think teletext is way more convenient until until we have the same commodities. I I don't see the logic in elimination of teletext, Yeah, and neither do I in fact. a a and th the message really we wanna be sending to them is that, although teletext may become outdated w there's no l logic in not having it in there anyway i if it doesn't affect the price. Which is a pretty basic function that w we've opted out of. I think we can say with certainty now that we are supporting teletext. I don't know what kind of role we have in this in the corporate ladder, do we follow their directives or do we make presentations back and and then and then discuss? beca I I do not I do not see the market niche for the product that they're handing f handing us right now. If we if w if we were going to have a product that worked for D_V_D_s, V_C_R_s and everything, then I can see the market niche, because who wants just a television remote? If we can take
So I I still think if it's cheap enough functionality-wise to include, it really should be in there. just I I would I would advocate for continuing teletext and those would be the basic commands. I I don't see the logic in elimination of teletext, I think we can say with certainty now that we are supporting teletext.
well the most the most costly components are gonna be the chip
we we can certainly push for a more expensive product if that's gonna be Well, see I I see I I'm an advocate to make this an exclusive product. Let's make this thing really exclusive, environmentally sensitive, high-tech design, ergonomics, all of this. I just don't know about that, because in order to do that in order to price it at that kind of level I think we'd need to have every functionality that all the other competitors are offering like being able to operate, you know, the D_V_D_ player and, you know, the stereo system and all that. Which is a pretty basic function that w we've opted out of. I think we can say with certainty now that we are supporting teletext. But I do think there are some basic features that we don't have that a lot of other remotes are going to have. They gave us a fundament a foundation of of what they want, and and w it's our place to kinda analyse and evaluate. I don't know what kind of role we have in this in the corporate ladder, do we follow their directives or do we make presentations back and and then and then discuss? beca I I do not I do not see the market niche for the product that they're handing f handing us right now. I think our market niche is basically people who need who have lost their remote and then they're gonna look on the shelf and they're gonna see ours is the nicest looking remote. I th I think it's important to remember that that this remote has to work with multiple T_V_s, yeah, 'cause it's selling on its own. All you need to do is train them to the individual one, they've identified the product as not working for anything but televisions. If we if w if we were going to have a product that worked for D_V_D_s, V_C_R_s and everything, then I can see the market niche, because who wants just a television remote? If you're in the market for this ultimate remote, you're not gonna
And it's kind of along the s lines of environmentally sensitive, and it may even fit into ergonomics, and even kind of address the issue of losing losing the remote, what we were saying it's a common issue. what we can do is, well you know that batteries throwing a aw remotes run through batteries like crazy. Right? Well maybe not a solar remote but instead what about if we had like a power cradle? Like a a cradle that is is there to hold the remote when you're not using it, and we can, instead of having instead of having, you know, replaceable batteries we'll just have a power cell that stays there for the life of the remote. 'cause you have to put it back there to charge the remote, I I think it's a good opportunity for the user design You know you could have some kind of neat little, you know, a sexy design for d a cradle and the remote itself. I like the idea, but we're talking about in cost is gonna probably double. And you could page the remote if you lose it. Now the the question is can we make this for less than twelve-fifty per? No no. No no, we have t we have to change the end cost. We we well do we necessarily have to change the end cost because Can we dl can we do that without changing it twelve-fifty per product, if we basically can sell more based on this? I my reaction is no, but what I can do is I can d look into ho well Pedro and I can look into how much this might increase our our costs I w I don't wanna go over somewhere and put it down. It i if it is gonna be somewhere that you put it down then it needs to be at the side of your armchair, and that implies that there's only one T_V_ user. it would last for several hours on its own power, but when you're done with it you put it back in
but we're talking about in cost is gonna probably double. But it it takes away the ease of use of the remote to a certain extent.
Onto participant four. 'til you spoke and when I wrote this, I don't know what I'm marketing. I just know that I I was identified as a a we identified ourselves as a as a developer, as a manufacturer, and as a as a distributor t to other wholesalers. And so the th the twenty-five Euros that we've identified as the sale price is a wholesale price rather than a retail price. so what I did is I I decided that that this this needs to be a product in a in a sense can market itself. We're making the most beautiful attractive whatever we decide it is. so I would like to have a product that that we can sell easily. so having something beauty, something attractive, something that in a sense will sell itself. innovation I think fits into what we're talking about here with design. cutting edge technology, I don't think we're gonna have that, unless we come up with some New Age product a as far as the casing is concerned. I I talked about environmentally sensitive, maybe we have a product that can be identified in some way as advantageous in a home. I wanted to talk about who we are as a as a corporation, that we're new, we're aggressive, we're competitive, we're we're trying to provide a product from a new perspective rather than from an old corporate line. So to me it's about selling d our identity our corporate identity along with the product. we're kind of in the middle of the market, but again, because what I see is budget restrictions and limitations, I don't know that we can bring any new technology into this thing.
But I t I think what the the management recommendation was less that there's a worry that teletext will become outdated rather than we shouldn't have it. and although I th I th I'm still here recommending the teletext so I'll remove that, I guess, So I I still think if it's cheap enough functionality-wise to include, it really should be in there. I mean even if it's necessary or not, if you if you're given the choice between a t a remote with teletext or without when it really if it i if it isn't more expensive for us to k make because as far as I understand it, it can be operated with the same set of buttons, yeah? i it's just the cost of an extra button. I in the very beginning it said with the with the advent of computers there's gonna be the it's gonna be out-moded teletext. I I don't understand how those two things are connected. How does how does computers and teletext h how why is one eliminating the need of the other? Well maybe what we're getting into here is the the idea of Internet through the T_V_ for example. the they're basically aiming at saying that you would use you know a couple of years ago teletext to be the easiest way to check like for the scheduling and the next programme and stuff like that But I still think teletext is way more convenient until until we have the same commodities. I just I don't see the cross-over between computers and television. I mean I do see the cross-over in some sense, but but but but with the the remote is is used for television, okay. Well there there is a for example on digital T_V_ systems you have you can press a button and you can buy things in adverts, They're just features from the Internet from computers are are coming into the T_V_ sort of under the covers, Yeah, and there's other features for example on other systems where you can pause live T_V_ and things like that
So yeah function design. what I found is we want to do fashion and I think, honestly, we should keep technology low and just simple basically and try to aim for design. basically a case will will cost the same if it looks good or bad so we ma we have to make it look good. something cute and small. The big chunky remotes are died in the eighties. And although mo most people will buy s televisions and everything for that have loads of loads of little functions and everything and they mostly end up using simple functions and little things and most the people won't won't get too mad of actually having to go the to the s to the television to, for instance, tune in their the stations. There's no need to have that in the remote. as for what I would recommend for the the interface design, and I will change the colours on the on the logo, but we should go for the user-oriented device, so simple controls and good ergonomics. and although I th I th I'm still here recommending the teletext so I'll remove that, I guess,
So depending on what we want our functionality to be, the chip could be expensive or it could be cheap. depending on the n amount of memory we need in there and stuff like that and h and h you know how much power.
I'm the Industrial Designer. And we've some basic components that our remote is gonna need, just basically every remote'll need 'em. We need some kinda of power d power source. we have to decide on our our user interface, which is his department, but the in user interface is also a major component. we need a programmable digital signal processor to to take the input from the user and translate that into into electronic signal, which we pass to the infra-red L_E_D_, which you aim at the television which and it receives that signal. You need a on-off switch And we also need to have the if we want a universal remote we need to have encryption codes for the different makes of T_V_s. So we need to know all the different you know all the different signals and so that'll require some memory as well. so here's just a basic layout of how how the remote would work. You ha the v the power source is in the upper right-hand corner there, and you can see that we have the user interface here which is connected to the chip which does all our signal processing, and then passes that signal on to the infra-red L_E_D_ and that signal is then emitted and received by the television at the photo-transistor. We're talking about existing technology. this is just this is just a basic layout of ev of all the components that w w are gonna be absolutely necessary f to have a working remote. We can add things in like if we wanted some voice recognition, I mean that I mean that you can kinda say would would fall under the user interface and the digital signal processing chip. Do we have an idea of costs of different components? well the most the most costly components are gonna be the chip basically the user interface and the casing are gonna be expensive as well. the L_E_D_ and the the transistors and everything else are you know they're they're pretty cheap. We we have to wait until we get to a more
So our big questions here really are cradle or not cradle? Do we go basic or do we go for features? d does anyone really wanna do anything with the scroll wheel or should we ditch that off-hand first? Well my question is what would the scroll wheel do? Yeah. Well it's it's just another way to do the exact same thing that the buttons do. now what I see with the scroll wheel is everybody has buttons. So from a marketing standpoint I have I have another door to walk through when we have something that's unique. What I understand about scroll wheels is they're they're quite expensive to to make. if if we're gonna make up the extra cost by extra sales I think maybe it's worth it to do it, but I mean I would just use if I was gonna do this I would just use the scroll wheel for s channels up and channels down. No we can we can do multiple scroll wheels but my personal preference is focusing the p the product on the idea of the the case the the dock to put it in to to charge it. We can target like environmentally friendly ideas, that sorta things. It's gonna need to be more expensive because of the cradle. What type of casing? I personally like what you were saying about the plastic with the rubber. I'm thinking yeah something like kinda almost like these pens, you know, and then it's not really rubber where there's you have plastic bits but just kinda like a fused the plastic with rubber on the outside. or do we want if we're ditching the scroll wheels do we want to go L_C_D_? d d do we want to do anything more basic with the more advanced with the user interface in terms of do we want to go for buttons, Or from from my perspective I think L_C_D_ is a mistake and all you're doing I mean it's you're not gonna get any information back from the television, so the only information you can display
Trend watching I guess. When I s when I see the when I see the product I I I I don't wanna buy it. There's nothing about that product that makes me wanna choose that product over other products that are out there. Are you talking about the picture? That's not our that's not our b design, Okay 'cause 'cause right now I don't have too much to say about how to market this product because we don't have a product to market yet. And from from talking to Mike is that we have we have we can market a more expensive product now. without special or increased marketable features I don't believe the product has a consumer demand. I like the idea of of the scroll what I'm looking for as marketing is m give me something different. I give me a lower price, give me a higher price, give me some new technology, when we when we have something like the cradle or or something give that's I'd I'd say though that we if we did make the decision to go with the cradle though, the then we have that as well, Well right I think the two big th points that we have so far are the having the cradle and also having the the actual design of the case itself having like this like rubber shell maybe with a plastic interior, Just remember when I made up this report I didn't have the information that we're discussing here. so what I'm saying is, from my perspective, I don't have a product to market right now. my personal preference is that we make some adjustment in the cost, either lower or develop an integrated new technol technology. Yeah again I'm not sold on the product because we don't have a product in my opinion yet. If you if you give me if you give me a cut-out of what everybody else has then I need to I need to find a lower cost.
So right details th that we've talked about here are that we want a scroll wheel. We want a mode indicator. We want back-lit buttons. Just so you know I think I mean it was my understanding that before we were gonna stay in the mid-market range. Just a very thin sorta sheet for a a grip, sorta thing or for
Oh interface concept. our manufacturing division wanted the speech recognition. They say they could put it to work but we don't think so. It it it you'll be you know be affected by the by the other speech and I mean it'll if somebody says up in the middle of a television show, it's gonna change the channel. But what if you actually had to press a button to make it recognize? Well then why don't you just press the up button? Even still there's gonna be interf th there's there still will be interference from the T_V_. I think it's a bad idea frankly.
So right details th that we've talked about here are that we want a scroll wheel. We want a mode indicator. Okay so we'll come up with something between thirty five and fifty that is rug rubber, robust, with scroll wheel, with the new facilities of the scroll wheel like favourite stuff, favourite channels, and and with a cradle, and yeah and the locator.
For electronics, we have these very technical descriptions here. A simple chip, which is the least expensive, a regular chip, which is like the medium porridge the medium expense D do we have actually any concept of what the difference is between a simple chip and an advanced chip? but I have no numbers to give you, A simple chip is required to operate push buttons. an advanced chip is required to to operate the L_C_D_ display, and it didn't say specifically, but I I have a hunch that a regular chip is gonna be the scroll wheel and the multiple scroll wheels. That's the end of my presentation.
Okay so we'll come up with something between thirty five and fifty that is rug rubber, robust, with scroll wheel, with the new facilities of the scroll wheel like favourite stuff, favourite channels, and and with a cradle, and yeah and the locator. but just kinda like a fused the plastic with rubber on the outside. Just a very thin sorta sheet for a a grip, sorta thing or for
Well, we wanna small r remote control one side because we want it to be cool and designed, but apparently market shows that bigger s bigger remotes get less lost, But yeah I think we we need to compromise between those two and somehow we'll do that. Somehow. so the the what I would propose is something more or less in the direction of what is to yo the right of that slide but without with a l a less complicated design, so the numbers, the volume control, and channel control, and teletext access. the volume and channel control can just become those the the four button array as in if it was a round dial. And if you just think about it as the one to the right but with the numbers and the four buttons plus maybe a centre one with teletext. So we're suggesting doing a sorta scroll wheel thing for the volume? i i it's just four buttons that are on a cross, yeah so I think we w we go for something mid-sized, so something looks good and is not too prone to get lost.
With a cradle, radio transmitters, and back-lit buttons.
Yeah so taking that away, our the the the rubber but rubber buttons are the more reliable it's the the ones that would al would allow us to to market our product as being you know less prone to damage and more resistant to things like spillage of liquids over it
Yeah, I was gonna say thirty five to fifty. Thirty five to fifty Euros is our sales bracket okay.
So here are options for our power sources. You can use a basic battery, which we've already discussed, th our tech department also said we have the option of doing some kind of hand dynamo where maybe you crank it or something like that. So that's the next bullet is the the kinetic provision of energy, so it's like that flashlight where you have to shake it. we've got solar cells, which I don't think is a very good idea because you could not use your remote at night And finally we've got our cradle o our power cradle idea. Okay so we basically have battery versus cradle here? I like the kinetic. Well it is it is more I mean it is more eco-friendly than the than the cradle We have choices in materials and choices in the general shapes that we can do. Our material choices are a plastic latex ty or plastic, a rubber latex type thing, wood, or titanium. If we go with titanium we're gonna be limited in the amount of shapes we can do Wood wood would ge would give us a little bit of a marketing niche, wouldn't it. I I can't see anybody wanting to use a wooden remote, whatever product you put in there we can find a way to accentuate it. my recommendation personally would be to do some kind of a plastic inner shell with a like a rubber outer shell, to make it to mak like a thick plastic inner shell and a t kind of a to have that rubber outer shell to make it more durable, The advantages of working with plastic and rubber is w we we'll have a lot more options just in terms of shape But basically these are curved and double-curved I I believe that the tech department, in their in their message to me, that they were referring to the number of th curves in the bottom. I have no idea exactly what they're talking about, but that's what they told me, uncurved, flat, curved, or double-curved. I think curved means just
Components design. So so here's a look inside your really old-looking remote control. you've got a printed a printed circuit board here, and you've got all these buttons which kinda press down little rubber nubbies into these little holes that activate So you've also got you've got your chip here, your batteries here, and some sorta electronics. so you've got here's here's a transistor, and this amplifies your signal, you've got the L_E_D_ here on the end of the on the end of the printed circuit board. you've got a couple diodes here for I don't know who and whatnot. So we've got a i in this in this drawing he in this example here, this is a eighteen pin chip I dunno. it's two double A_ batteries. This is pretty standard remote.
I think it's a bad idea frankly.
Okay so you guys will be getting your modelling done now and
Okay so we'll come up with something between thirty five and fifty that is rug rubber, robust, with scroll wheel, with the new facilities of the scroll wheel like favourite stuff, favourite channels, and and with a cradle, and yeah and the locator. I think if you can have the base station with a with a locator, I think those are two very strong features,
Okay so we'll come up with something between thirty five and fifty that is rug rubber, robust, with scroll wheel, with the new facilities of the scroll wheel like favourite stuff, favourite channels, and and with a cradle, and yeah and the locator. With a cradle, radio transmitters, and back-lit buttons. I think if you can have the base station with a with a locator, I think those are two very strong features,
but I have no numbers to give you, I don't know exactly what the increased cost is gonna be, though we haven't got to a stage where we're ready to pin down the price of components. So we really need to be sure as to what we can push the cost up to,
Okay so you guys will be getting your modelling done now and
There's nothing about that product that makes me wanna choose that product over other products that are out there. without special or increased marketable features I don't believe the product has a consumer demand. or do we really need the scroll wheel as well? and I guess th th the question th th that you're being asked right now is whether is the dock enough of a unique feature to be able to go out and sell that a a as a a very different product, Because the scroll wheel comes at quite a cost.
though we haven't got to a stage where we're ready to pin down the price of components. So we really need to be sure as to what we can push the cost up to, I guess what I just want to me the next step is for these guys to come come in with the design proposal w with the cost estimate attached, I would say thirty five to forty. Yeah, I was gonna say thirty five to fifty. Thirty five to fifty Euros is our sales bracket okay. Let's let's try and think now, how much would you pay for But you've gotta think who our target market is Okay so we'll come up with something between thirty five and fifty that is rug rubber, robust, with scroll wheel, with the new facilities of the scroll wheel like favourite stuff, favourite channels, and and with a cradle, and yeah and the locator.
No it's not in there because I had the computer problem and I I I cou I couldn't create it. These cables suck. and it's a little uncomfortable to use but I guess it works. Yeah comfortable headsets would be nice. And of course I did not have so much fun with my computer this afternoon.
we kinda at least adjusted every every criteria they gave us yeah but we did we did break with the specs a little bit I guess,
The only limitations I see to this is that we're focused on television only. There's gonna be somebody going home and say oh sh this thing doesn't work for my D_V_D_ and my but I like these other things, so they keep it, they don't take it back. Well one of one of the thoughts that I had is can can this unit be be produced in a way that makes it upgradable?
Not the original budget, but they are now.
Are the costs within the budget? Not the original budget, but they are now.
So you ha you have like the the base station with the little button for the where's my remote. Beep beep beep. but we couldn't figure out what button is important enough to put there.
And there's one other feature that we were debating, but we decided to go against it, we were thinking that it might be interesting to have a trigger button here because you have this finger And we we don't wanna accidentally be hitting the power button like that so But maybe if you had a trigger plus the scroll then that would get past the the problem of it landing and scrolling,
Production costs estimated by our manufacturing department and the research department, which is us, is fifteen point eight Euros, we implemented the basic functions, which is just T_V_ functions plus the locator, cradle, scroll wheel for the the channels, and we implemented the f the the way of putting the new and revolutionary zapping, your favourite channels functionality, in the scroll. Scrolling through your favourites list. I like the the the the logo on there as well. so the scroll bar is or the scroll wheel is this this green little scrolly guy here, so this is the cradle unit, This is the teletext. So this bl this button will be used both for the favourites and for programming your the the type of television you wanna use. So the plastic is the white area of this of the model here, and the red area is like a rubber covering. and the buttons are all gonna be rubber, so it's pretty hard to actually damage it could that be easy to for the scroll wheel to be rotated if it lands on it? Yeah that might be a possible a mi possible problem, but if you drop it I take it that this is gonna be slightly lighter in the final design as well. but I think we might scale down the final model a bit. So you ha you have like the the base station with the little button for the where's my remote. Beep beep beep. And there's one other feature that we were debating, but we decided to go against it, we were thinking that it might be interesting to have a trigger button here because you have this finger but we couldn't figure out what button is important enough to put there. And we we don't wanna accidentally be hitting the power button like that so But maybe if you had a trigger plus the scroll then that would get past the the problem of it landing and scrolling, So maybe in a final design phase we might tweak that a little bit, But it's definitely got
Okay so we can talk about finance now. So I have a little spreadsheet for us I've made a f few assumptions here in that I'm assuming that our power adaptor we can make for a cost of four Euros, which I think is probably fair considering that we have in-house manufacturing of power adaptors already. and I'm assuming that the locator beacon, can be made for a similar price to an L_C_ display, I do think we that we we don't need the events chip on print, we only need the the regular chip on print, Is that a single-curved rather than a double-curved? So we come bring it down to Fifteen point four. See it's a little bit more than f single-curved. So yeah it's fifteen point eight, we haven't talked about any special colour though if we're going for greys and silvers then I don't think we're is this intended to be a button as well or just a scroll? That's a scroll. then we have fifteen point eight Euros. I think we we ended up being quite creative there.
It's single-curved, We're on to the pat-on-the-back part of the presentation, How how have we done today? I think we did pretty well. No, I think we come up with a with a attractive marketable product and and concept. Okay so th th what about room for creativity? Sh I think there was plenty of room. I think we we ended up being quite creative there. we kinda at least adjusted every every criteria they gave us yeah but we did we did break with the specs a little bit I guess, It was more of a teamwork thing then really leadership based project was These cables suck. So yeah the the pen came in alright and it's a little uncomfortable to use but I guess it works. What new ideas have we found? Well we had the favourites list, and the scroll bar, and we have the cradle, and the r remote call feature. Yeah comfortable headsets would be nice. And of course I did not have so much fun with my computer this afternoon. Are the costs within the budget? Not the original budget, but they are now.
I gotta do mine up at the board. So you're not gonna find my my folder up there No it's not in there because I had the computer problem and I I I cou I couldn't create it. And when I speak about method I speak about the marketing of the product. And to me with this product we got we got basically three things to market. We've got the features, we have the characteristics, The the corporation stands behind the product, okay. we've got you know the features that make this a unique product. we have reliability, we have comfort, we have ergonomics, we have environmentally s sensitive. One thing I would want to to see is is can we can we get a lifetime guarantee on this product, a normal use guarantee, it has the features and the characteristics, and the background, I believe, to make it marketable I believe at a cost of of of thirty thirty five to to fifty Euros. We're gonna be competitive, and we're gonna we're gonna have a market niche. would you a argue that that we're better going for the higher cost than bringing it down into twenty f five as we probably could, but lowering our profit margins? for my evaluation, based on what our competition is, I th I think that that we can go after this and at that cost I think it there's nobody else that's putting this this combination of of ingredients together. The only limitations I see to this is that we're focused on television only. There's gonna be somebody going home and say oh sh this thing doesn't work for my D_V_D_ and my but I like these other things, so they keep it, they don't take it back. Well one of one of the thoughts that I had is can can this unit be be produced in a way that makes it upgradable? W we need we need we need s some more buttons if it would to work on some other stuff, but Yeah, the plus there's the the risk of making it

W we need we need we need s some more buttons if it would to work on some other stuff, but Yeah, the plus there's the the risk of making it unusable as well, or making it less b because at the moment it's actually very straightforward to look at all the buttons,
Sh I think there was plenty of room. we kinda at least adjusted every every criteria they gave us yeah but we did we did break with the specs a little bit I guess, It was more of a teamwork thing then really leadership based project was
These cables suck. and it's a little uncomfortable to use but I guess it works. Yeah comfortable headsets would be nice. And of course I did not have so much fun with my computer this afternoon.
The tool training is to try out the white board, Maybe someone ha we have to this whiteboard, Maybe you can draw your favourite animal and make a list of its favourite characteristics. I don't know if we have to do it now, maybe later later. There was a step about drawing something in the in the board, Are we supposed to do right now? You can draw something which is very simple. It's a It's a cat. you have to draw a rat if you want a rat. It's a rabbit. Right. A fish.
the selling price of the product will be twenty five Euros. I think it's quite good price, yeah. And not too expensive.
it will be a an international remote control, so really the remote control to be international.
I'm Ada Longmund, and as you may know it, I'm the pr project manager. Our project project is to create a new remote control so the remote control has to be original, trendy and user-friendly. if we're the functional design, you have to do any individual work and also work with meetings talking with each other. it will be the same for the conceptual design and also the same for the detailed design.. the selling price of the product will be twenty five Euros. it will be a an international remote control, I think it's quite good price, yeah. and the product costs will be not more than twelve Euros and fifty centimes. try to create something new And and the next meeting will start in thirty minutes, you'll ha all have your spethisfispis specif specific role you will have to work on the design and also to work on the design of th technical fun functions of the remote control and think of the user requirement specifications. Those things just refer to each of each of us, I think. AMI I_D_ is for the Industrial Design, And U_I_D_, it's for the User Interface Designer, I will manage all all the group. and Marketing Expert, it's me. what's the difference between user interface design d industrial design? I suppose you have to design it and you have to take care of the industrial way to transform it. I I think the user the user interface design is he will design how the user will you know the relation between the user and you know the remote control so And the industrial design, it is how the object will look like. Maybe, it is the outside and the inside. 'cause the user interface to design for example where the but button will be, you know. I'm trying to give you some trends about what should be done and what the users would like to have and then thi this would I guess converged to the User Interface Designer wi and then Industrial Designer. so really the remote control to be international. And
Those things just refer to each of each of us, I think. AMI what's the difference between user interface design d industrial design? I suppose you have to design it and you have to take care of the industrial way to transform it. I I think the user the user interface design is he will design how the user will you know the relation between the user and you know the remote control so And the industrial design, it is how the object will look like. Maybe, it is the outside and the inside. 'cause the user interface to design for example where the but button will be, you know.
try to create something new And to be sure that really people will be interested in buying a new remote control with maybe new functionalities that don't exist in the existing remote controls now.
As you all know, you know m my job is to design you know to give an industrial design of the remote control. I propose a nifra infrared base I think it's cheaper than laser, so. what you find inside the re i the the system here inside it is just, you know a bulb and an infrared bulb, I have some kind of pictures and you have the other subcomponent There's a wire with remote control? I think it should be wire wireless re remote con and you know because you f the b the the battery problem can hold you know will you use a battery or the a wire to connected you. So you think that a cable between the remote control and the T_V_ won't be a good idea. maybe it will be cheaper I dunno but as Industrial Designer, do you think that it will be feasible to have linked or to have link between the remote control and the television? Do you think it will be cheaper? Could you answer please? Have to think about the question, but I think the wireless problem is more the David Jordan's problem. Mayb maybe you have just to to kind of research If when you have wireless remote control and if you lose it? I think it's would be easier to have a link between the remote control and the television,
The first I will present the technical function design for user interface for our remote T_V_ control. remote c rem remote T_V_ control it's very has very soph sophisticated functions, so we want to design elegant, easy to use inter interface. A very good example is Google. So my job is to design a Google T_V_ controller which I want to have sophisticated functions while with very easy to use user interface. So you propose to to have the remote control which will be powerful. With sophisticated functions, and very easy to use. it's maybe difficult to have both, I mean the the one on the right doesn't look so simple But if we have very very good user interface it take less time for user to learn how to use it. but the question is how to merge you know the Google system to the system, alright.
You will have as the I_D_ I don't remember what is industr Industrial Designer to put pon Component component, yeah.
but this this mean that your T_V_ would be able to, you know, connect to internet, you know, surf the web. There's that box in the T_V_, so with the set box you you can connect internet with your T_V_. I don't think it's popular, I think it has to be yellow. I think if you have you know th like a yellow ribbon here is the double R_. Or should be. Doesn't need to be completely yellow,
new information about the product requirements, the first one is that for the designing of the remote control we don't really want to use the teletext anymore, because now everybody has internet at home, and also the remote control will only be used for television, you won't had buttons to just to manipulate yeah to control the recorder or maybe the garage door or things like that. So maybe it will be easier for you to to design it, to have very powerful and easy. which will be used for for the television, for the recorder, for the camcorder and all the others, it will become too complex And also we want the image of the real reaction be recognisable in the product, such as the colour and s the slogan. So has to be yellow. As we say, we put the fashion in electronics, Require lot of requirements, Regarding the first line, what So we're just expecting no more use of the teletext. But I dunno, but why, I think it would be simpler.
the first one is that for the designing of the remote control we don't really want to use the teletext anymore, so it's better to use internet then teletext. because now everybody has internet at home,
So just trying to answer all the questions, We had one hundred subjects,, we observe their remote control use in a lab and then after all the experiments they had to fill up a questionnaire,, actually seventy five percent of the users find m the most remote controls ugly, Yeah, the the look is is bad for them Then eighty percent of users would spend more money actually if if the remote controls were not so ugly. And then yeah, the remote controls like the one you've shown previously it's not so doesn't fit the user requirements sometime, because it's too many buttons and so on. And users are actually zapping a lot, ten percent of the buttons are actually used in the remote control. remote controls are often lost somewhere in the room. it takes too much time to learn how to use the remote control for thirty five percent of the people. And remote control are really bad for R_S_I_ problems for twenty six percent of the users. R_S_I_ is like, when you're using the same doing the same movement several times, then you get injured. so my pres personal preferences for this problem is we have to meet the user needs. If we can make it look fancy then we might sell more than our concurrent, And definitely if it could have less buttons, still maybe the same number of functions, but less buttons, And just to have an idea, do you think you as the User Interface Designer to would it be possible to have less buttons and still have the same functionality and to have powerful remote control, you think it's possible? Yeah, I think possible. Because we can We can mix several function in one button. but do you think it will be easy to use? Because if you have many functions just for one button it would be quite difficult for the user to know. you you can have a switch menu, but it has to be intuitive. For example, if you have remote control you you can rem you can control your T_V_
and also the remote control will only be used for television, you won't had buttons to just to manipulate yeah to control the recorder or maybe the garage door or things like that.
And definitely if it could have less buttons, still maybe the same number of functions, but less buttons,
If we can make it look fancy then we might sell more than our concurrent,
and the User Interface Designer to work on the user interface concept.
And also we want the image of the real reaction be recognisable in the product, such as the colour and s the slogan.
And also we want the image of the real reaction be recognisable in the product, such as the colour and s the slogan.
As we say, we put the fashion in electronics, so it has to be a fashion remote control. Fancy, fashion, powerful, easy to use.
There's a wire with remote control? I think it should be wire wireless re remote con and you know because you f the b the the battery problem can hold you know will you use a battery or the a wire to connected you. So you think that a cable between the remote control and the T_V_ won't be a good idea. maybe it will be cheaper I dunno but as Industrial Designer, do you think that it will be feasible to have linked or to have link between the remote control and the television? Do you think it will be cheaper? Could you answer please? Have to think about the question, but I think the wireless problem is more the David Jordan's problem. Mayb maybe you have just to to kind of research If when you have wireless remote control and if you lose it? I think it's would be easier to have a link between the remote control and the television,
And just to have an idea, do you think you as the User Interface Designer to would it be possible to have less buttons and still have the same functionality and to have powerful remote control, you think it's possible? Yeah, I think possible. Because we can We can mix several function in one button. but do you think it will be easy to use? Because if you have many functions just for one button it would be quite difficult for the user to know. you you can have a switch menu, but it has to be intuitive. For example, if you have remote control you you can rem you can control your T_V_ and also you can control your recorder. so maybe just having many functions in one button is not that good if you want to zap a lot.
I think the solution is to have many colours of you know instead of having one grey standard but I think it will increase the price of the production of the remote control. Maybe we can have di di we can have several options, I think it has to be yellow. I think if you have you know th like a yellow ribbon here is the double R_. Or should be. Doesn't need to be completely yellow,
I I think I will let our User Interface Designer speak first, Mister David Jordan. there's three concepts in the user interface. So first one it's a Google controller. The second is a fancy controller. The last one is intelligent controller. I want the controller to be easy to use, but with sophisticated functions. the first is Google controller. The second concept is a fancy controller, we want give the customers the impression that our controller is very attractive, the u the user f the the u user interface should be very very cute, very very g Such like this, there are several examples in the slides. I'm not sure the one in the middle is very attractive. We'll have big discussion I suppose after that, the last concept is intelligent. so maybe we should use technology, such as speech recognition technology and gesture recognition technology, so we need to have coop some cooperation with some research institute on speech recognition and gesture recognition. With this advanced features we I think we can attract a lot of user. stick to the first two parts. So what's the difference between our controller with other products in the market? so is there is there any necessary to design new controller without any breakthrough features? Would y would you replace your controller with a controller with similar function if you do not have some some function inside it that we can add for example some function like for browsing in internet, so or something like that. you y that's a fun that's not the function of the controller, so I I guess if can have a remote control that is really basic, simple and works fine, it's already a lot. if he has something that works fine and is really fancy, looks nice and it's easy easy to use, easy to use. But the there's there's n there's n not enough motivation for them to replace their old controller with a new one if there's no key feature in the new controller.
It was in fact the design use to show you the design of what is inside a what is inside and what are the different component of the r So it will be interesting so I could show you some some picture of what is inside something I want to discuss is which kind of material are we going to use, will it will be wooden wooden di wooden remote control or a a plastic remote control like this one. in which which which kind will be the the different bu button, it can be some, you know, classic pushbutton like this one, or you have also some button like L_C_D_ the other thing I want to discuss also is which kind of alimentation, electric alimentation do you want to have, so will it be for example d solar energy alimentation or will it be a battery like the classical battery for example in some country where you are in the the countryside and you are far from, you know, the cities for example in some place in in S Senegal, so if you have electric if you have solar alimentation, you just, when you want to have recharger or remote control power you just put it on the sun and after one hour you can come and maybe it can attract all the ecological k yeah consumers but about the the price of adding this solar battery, would it be something really that will increase the price of production more, if we want to have battery, regular battery and and the solar energy battery it could be it'll it will add a little bit of the price, the plastic material is more common but, you know, something wooden will be like, I don't know high cl so a special high class, and i if you we want to put fashion in electronics maybe we can try to do something with wood. the last point is y also would do you want to have some very cheap integrated cir circuits, chips, or do you have low level or or very very
because for the intelligent controller, you said that we can use the voice recognition or the gesture recognition, but as the expert told us, most of the people want to use the remote control to zap t to zap between channels. Do you think they will be able to use gestures? Because, if they do all the time the same gesture, as you said previously in the last meeting, maybe they will get injuries because of that? or if you say channel three channel three two three four six five, I think they will be bored after a while. I think some time it's very convenient to use voice interface and gesture interface than use button. For example, if you cannot find your controller, you can just just just speak something such as, yeah, one two. but suppose you got a cold. You have a mute remote controller. but how how is how risky is it to trust like speech recognition or gesture recognition? For limited vocabulary speech recognition is very reliable and for s limited vocabulary gesture recognition is also very but suppose you have a family watching T_V_, and if they want to use their private remote control in the same time, do you think it will work? Everybody wanting to change channel in the same time? so they say oh channel four channel three channel four channel three all the time, that's that's the advantage of intelligent controller. Even you h you have the controller, I can I can say channel three, No, but this is disadvant disadvantage. And mayb maybe we can have the switching mode to pass from you know voice controller to How how much will it cost? more expensive maybe. we don't have to do some basic research on this field. y y you have also the language problem, 'Cause it it have to be universal, The vocabulary is very small, but there is one problem that Baba talked about is the international The recognition system will be able to understand French. this could be downloaded by the web maybe, And with no increase
we have to take decisions about the component concepts, about the energy. maybe using solar energy and with battery would be something interesting, I think we can have wood for example in the bottom and, you know. No wood Something spongy. cheap imprint so you s you propose low level chips would be enough to have something working well. It's it's natural. so maybe we can stay with wood. But we could maybe have both like part of wood and some rubber for the buttons, and what about the user interface concept? Google and fancy? Because I think that with the voice and gesture recognition there are still some disadvantages with this. the problem is I I'm we can infer i if you have v voice control why not to put it directly on the the T_V_, so speak directly to the T_V_ and you don't need a remote control actually, So maybe we'll just focus on the Google controller plus the fancy controller, maybe try to mix them these two concepts together, just in one and do a remote control with solar energy and batteries and with lev low level chips and wood. And L_C_D_ buttons. I think for these supplements the solar energy would be something quite interesting and not maybe too difficult to add. commands, words and use them when you don't want to use your fingers. Even it is for s just some kids, you know, switching channels one two three four. Not very complex commands, but easy commands, Yeah, simple ones Okay.
trend watching. just to meet the user requirements I would just do a s short anal analysis of the remote control market and to kind of have a better overview of what's the fashion in general I've checked more than only the remote control market, user really really want a fancy look and feel. Like the one you've shown, David, with all the buttons and I mean i i it sounds good technically second point is they still want it it to be technologically innovative, so maybe it's sort of related to what you've said with the speech recognition and so on. At the same time, it's important that it's easy to use. that were the three first points from the remote control analysis. Wha what we really see this year is that everything from clothes to shoes and furniture is is inspired by fruits and vegetables, so I think we really have to take this into account for the design of the the thing. And then if if we take the ordering or the ranking of all the points, fancy look and feel has, on a score of seven would have six as importance. the remote control has to be technologically innovative, it's three. Then easy to use it's not so important actually with respect to other y other ones. And the other point I haven't mention is people wan want to have a spongy touch, this is this maybe doesn't really fit with the wooden design. but the problem is which kind of material do you need to to be spongy? plastic-like, but rubber, mayb maybe, you know, rubber-like
you will have to work more, Baba, on the spongy way to to add spongy touch to the buttons and try to find maybe a nice shape for the wooden remote control.
So you will have to work on the look and feel design, to have the easy to use, powerful and fancy remote control with some added value such as the simple vocal commands recognition.
I think it would be better not to do any intelligent controller
So you will have Baba and David Jordan you will have to work together on the prototype and you will have next time to show us modelling a cl a clay remote control,
And L_C_D_ buttons.
Yeah, simple ones Okay.
but as the expert told us, most of the people want to use the remote control to zap t to zap between channels. because for the intelligent controller, you said that we can use the voice recognition or the gesture recognition, Do you think they will be able to use gestures? Because, if they do all the time the same gesture, as you said previously in the last meeting, maybe they will get injuries because of that? or if you say channel three channel three two three four six five, I think they will be bored after a while. I think some time it's very convenient to use voice interface and gesture interface than use button. For example, if you cannot find your controller, you can just just just speak something such as, yeah, one two. but suppose you got a cold. You have a mute remote controller. but how how is how risky is it to trust like speech recognition or gesture recognition? For limited vocabulary speech recognition is very reliable and for s limited vocabulary gesture recognition is also very but suppose you have a family watching T_V_, and if they want to use their private remote control in the same time, do you think it will work? Everybody wanting to change channel in the same time? so they say oh channel four channel three channel four channel three all the time, that's that's the advantage of intelligent controller. Even you h you have the controller, I can I can say channel three, No, but this is disadvant disadvantage. And mayb maybe we can have the switching mode to pass from you know voice controller to How how much will it cost? more expensive maybe. we don't have to do some basic research on this field. y y you have also the language problem, 'Cause it it have to be universal, The vocabulary is very small, but there is one problem that Baba talked about is the international The recognition system will be able to understand French. this could be downloaded by the web maybe, And with no increase
this is this maybe doesn't really fit with the wooden design. but the problem is which kind of material do you need to to be spongy? plastic-like, but rubber, mayb maybe, you know, rubber-like Something spongy. No wood I think we can have wood for example in the bottom and, you know. It's it's natural. so maybe we can stay with wood.
Google and fancy? So maybe we'll just focus on the Google controller plus the fancy controller,
maybe using solar energy and with battery would be something interesting, maybe try to mix them these two concepts together, just in one and do a remote control with solar energy and batteries and with lev low level chips and wood.
cheap imprint so you s you propose low level chips would be enough to have something working well. maybe try to mix them these two concepts together, just in one and do a remote control with solar energy and batteries and with lev low level chips and wood.
so maybe we can stay with wood. maybe try to mix them these two concepts together, just in one and do a remote control with solar energy and batteries and with lev low level chips and wood.
So it's v, you can put it in the table so you can turn the the ball to cha to select the channel If you want to turn the ball, it's very it's very convenient for you to to to turn the ball to change the channel. Yeah but how how intuitive is it to turn things to change channels? Yeah I'm I'm no I'm not definitely convinced it's it's the best way to if you wanna jump from, I dunno, one to twenty? But this this has to stay on the table, right? In fact on a flat place You need to have everything in hand. If you want to turn, you can't use it and turn. You know tha that's the weak point,
It's looks like some mushroom, so we call it mushroom design. Yeah but it's not like really mushroom because you have you know like lemon shape, you know, Yeah, because mushroom was not in the trends. Fruits and vegetables. Looks like more fruit. It looks more like a pineapple. let's say it's a pineapple now.
yeah, another thing is the logo is missing still. It's yeah but it I don't think it's such a problem just putting the logo somewhere. f like y we can we can put some double R_ So maybe we can just integrate it on th on one side, the double R_.
An but we have integrated scroll wheel with push dut button. I think there's a problem with the push push button. So we have one button,
An but we have integrated scroll wheel with push dut button. One s one scroll wheel, so
Maybe if w t if suppose if we change and we g put just one?
Double curve. We can transform the double curve into single c yeah.
There's no wood, so plastic just only, I think. I think you can transform the wood into plastic, maybe.
It looks more like a pineapple. let's say it's a pineapple now. But I d m I think that it will be good to do some more work to transform this into a pineapple.
but we have solar cells. I think you can transform the wood into plastic, maybe. We could turn we could turn everything in either yellow or black. An but we have integrated scroll wheel with push dut button. Double curve. We can transform the double curve into single c yeah. One s one scroll wheel, so So we have one button, So, yeah. It think we we've done good job, as the cost is It's fine, twelve fifty
So did you enjoy your clay modelling? Yes. Of course. This is my job. Yeah, I think I find it really funny and amazing and interesting to go through all the process to from the beginning to the end. And designing, looking at the chips, the solar cells and and it was very informative for. tha that was good but we should have more brainstorming like meetings, maybe. 'Cause we just presenting one is presenting his stuff next one his stuff and then we try to combine afterwards, so it. So I think the costs are within the budget. do you think you can celebrate your creation? And you can celebrate your leadership. I'm not so happy about the fruit shape, you know. and we have a nearly final product.
It need maybe some wo further work, but it's Yeah, especially on the easy to use But I d m I think that it will be good to do some more work to transform this into a pineapple.
we need to calculate the production cost. As I said in the first meeting we need to have so a remote control that would cost not more than twelve and point fifty Euros., how many do y do you need, solar cells? I think in each ball you have three Single simple chip on print? And sample sensor, sample speaker.. One maybe, yeah. So we are all already nineteen. The solar cell is too expensive. There's no wood, so plastic just only, I think. We have two special colours. We have change the electronics to from from the the the sample sensor to regular chip. Oh. Yeah w one of the m key point is solar cells. Maybe if w t if suppose if we change and we g put just one? I think you can transform the wood into plastic, maybe. We could turn we could turn everything in either yellow or black. An but we have integrated scroll wheel with push dut button. Double curve. We can transform the double curve into single c yeah. I think there's a problem with the push push button. So we have one button, One s one scroll wheel, so Yeah, maybe two scroll wheel, as we have the coarse coarse to fine scroll wheel. Okay we I think we have problem. I think we s if we keep on adding things Push button.. Yeah, we have four. I think it's more like double curved.
Yeah but it's not like really mushroom because you have you know like lemon shape, you know, And inspired colour and and very sophisticated material, so. Yeah, the shape is unique, Maybe if you change if you take the buttons out, I dunno, maybe improving the texture of like having it less smooth or If you want to turn the ball, it's very it's very convenient for you to to to turn the ball to change the channel. And where is the voice recognition?, it's embedded, your microphone. First one is we have to judge the fancy look and feel. No, the colour is okay, that's fine. but I would say there is more too much red. Right. So, from one to seven? Three. The other criterion is is it technologically technologically in innovative. There four microphone. Yeah bu but when you say technologically it's more I dunno, in the core, or single. We have tactile buttons. is it easy to use?, for th the vocal command yes, it's might be easy. and you can turn like that to change the channel? then the angle you stop is the angle you is the channel you How d how do you know this angle is th is the correct one? It's it's very easy, because you kn you know how many channel are there in the I think it's easier than traditional controller. you have you just turn the turn the ball. it's reasonable three. those are sort of agreed but this one would be more five to me. But this this has to stay on the table, right? In fact on a flat place You need to have everything in hand. If you want to turn, you can't use it and turn. You know tha that's the weak point, Yeah, you would never you would never lose this one, yeah. Yeah, four it's more reasonable, so. yeah, another thing is the logo is missing still.
And you can turn it so maybe it's techno technologically innov innovative? Yeah, so you can capture s voice from different directions. Yeah. And I think you you've never seen a rou a round remote control, so it is I see, you have microphone array embedded. I think technically it's acceptable, so I would say two Yeah but this this turning Yeah but how how intuitive is it to turn things to change channels? and you can turn like that to change the channel? Yeah I'm I'm no I'm not definitely convinced it's it's the best way to if you wanna jump from, I dunno, one to twenty? Oh yeah, that's difficult. That's dif that's difficult. How d how do you know this angle is th is the correct one? It's it's very easy, because you kn you know how many channel are there in the I think b but the the vocal command is easy too. So it's coarse to fine design. that's very technologic, so. Yeah. yeah it's a sleeping remote control., that's not the ecological part, yeah. W that why we have the solar ti yeah. To compensate. I think it's easier than traditional controller. you have you just turn the turn the ball. But this this has to stay on the table, right? In fact on a flat place You need to have everything in hand. If you want to turn, you can't use it and turn. You know tha that's the weak point, Yeah, you would never you would never lose this one, yeah. Yeah, especially on the easy to use
we'll have first the project presentation by our User Interface Designer, David Jordan, and our Industrial Designer, Baba. And the shape, there's two basic shape. The first is a circle and the second is a triangle s piece. So there are several key features of our pr prototype. The first is that it is fuzzy. I'm sure this would be the unique design the market. the second key feature is that s circle channel selection. the third feature is a stable triangle base. So it's v, you can put it in the table so you can turn the the ball to cha to select the channel the low level chips inside It is in th in in the base, yeah. The battery it is under. In fact this this this this is a kind of you know revolutionary solar receptor that we can put outside and
the basic colour is yellow and red. It's looks like some mushroom, so we call it mushroom design. Yeah but it's not like really mushroom because you have you know like lemon shape, you know, Looks like more fruit. It looks more like a pineapple.
so, it seems the the first thing that they've kinda specified is the price like based on how much profit we wanna make, but I guess if that's if that's the requirement that we need to to design the the product to actually fit that that price bracket
So you have to work on the on the working design, you have to work on the technical functions, and you have to work on us user requirements specs,
So we need to close the meeting. So you have to work on the on the working design, you have to work on the technical functions, and you have to work on us user requirements specs, you will receive some information by emails, i as usual.
So, the goal of this project is to developed a new remote control.
you will receive some information by emails, i as usual.
And we should target the inter an international market.
So we should target selling price of twenty-five Euro for this remote control
which which would generate a profit of of fifty million Euros, okay.
is this a stand-alone unit that we're gonna be selling?
So we should target selling price of twenty-five Euro for this remote control
which which would generate a profit of of fifty million Euros, okay.
so another important part of the project is about money,
so we are going to go through the white board and take some s some notes or do some drawings. Okay so, want me to draw my favourite animal. Well, I don't really have a favourite animal, but I'm gonna about the spider I dunno why, but when I was a child I I wanted to be a a panther So, not the favourite animal, but I think I'll draw elephant.
So we should decide which kind of remote control we want to we want to we want to go. should it be specific remote control to some specific device? Should it be a universal one?
As usual we will follow the the project method that we are using in the in our company. It is in three step as you know. First the functional design. The second's a conceptual design, and then the detailed design. During each step of each design we wi you will work s separately, individually on your specific tasks and will m we will meet to to discuss and take decisions about what you've you've you did and what we will do next.
it should be original, trendy, and also user friendly.
So, the goal of this project is to developed a new remote control.
I'm Michael. I'm the user interface designer. Hi I'm Guillermo. I'm the Marketing Expert. And I am Hemant, the industrial designer.
So, we're here today to to have our first kick-off meeting about this new project we're going to tak to talk about in a few minutes. so I will be Sebastian the Project Manager.
And finally, the incorporation of a L_C_D_ or a speech recognition system in the remote control could also be interesting, but I don't know if the budget would be large enough. But most of yeah most of the young people to thirty to thirty years old were really interested in this kind of technology. I think even even if it was within budget do a speech reco rec system it might be a bit difficult because if you think if you're watching T_V_ you're gonna have a lot of this background noise from the T_V_ which might interfere with the it could be command control kind of thing. It requir recognises particular sequence and then it gets activated.
So maybe we could start with the market, yeah. and we have to find the weaknesses and and the the improvements we could do to the current remote controls. And also I di I did a study with for the incorporation of new technologies Well more most of the people think that remote controls are ugly, thoroughly. So and they they admit that the the they should s they would spend more money in a fancier remote control, the the younger people are the more interested they are in incorporating new technologies in the in the remote control. So in my opinion the Mando this Mando shouldn't be very small So it may be interesting to to think in a in both prototypes, for right and left handed people. Well th the on the thing is though, most remote controls are used by more than one person. Well maybe it could be a universal design.
But first I would like quickly to to decide of to give a name to the project. So, I just put d quickly Remo, Any ideas? the Powerstick. Maybe a Spanish name would work well. Mando. What does it mean in Spanish? Control. So, let's go for Mando?
Okay, let's have a look to the agenda today. So, we are going to have a meeting about the functional design. so first before starting I w just going to to go quickly to through the minutes of previous meeting. So basically we we are not decided if w we should go for a universal or specific remote control, but I have new new i inputs for about that topics. I goin I'm going to share with you. so we are going to go through three of your individual presentations.
user i interface could be of two types, one is the usual press buttons which are there so that the user feels that he is knoing doing some he is knowing about that technology. and on top of that there there could be a speech recognition technology also being sitting on the on the remote. And for voice, limited vocabulary automatic speech recognition system is required and we require a microphone also to be sitting there on the remote. That increases the the cost also.
So so my feeling is that re regarding costs budget we have an an an target price, it's not possible to go s to go to L_C_D_ So you could have the name of the programme, you could have the start time you know where it's up to. so that mean w w we need an in an extra internet connection to use the remote control, if you want to browse, in addition to the T_V_, or or it should be a special T_V_ connected to I think the type of people that are gonna want to buy a very stylish rem r remote control with lots of new technologies are the kinda people that are gonna have you know a wireless internet connection maybe, or a you know.
user i interface could be of two types, one is the usual press buttons which are there so that the user feels that he is knoing doing some he is knowing about that technology. and on top of that there there could be a speech recognition technology also being sitting on the on the remote. but we have seen before that there is a new way of interacting that use wheel. Do you think that performance of such systems are enough to to target well of such technologies is enough? Well wh I imagine also that the microphone will be an ambiance a an ambience microphones Well one one other thing that that speech recognition could really blow out the price for is when you want to sell into other markets, though, my personal preference was that we can have A_S_R_ sitting there on the remote control. I'm sure if you can sell a a speech recognition remote control for twenty five Euros everyo everyone will s will buy it. Actually I'm not so sure you know if I was using a remote control to, say, turn the volume up because I can't hear it very well, I don't really want to you know drown out what people are saying by talking you know when I'm when I'm instead of pressing up on on a remote control.
but one possibility is to download program information into the L_C_D_ screen So this is something else we might wanna consider, is really kind of limiting the number of buttons, but I think also you know the location and and shape of the buttons is important, but also the number of buttons. I think maybe one option is to have you know a little flip-open door that that you have hidden most of the time, but contains the extra buttons like, say, the number buttons for instance. if I had my perfect remote control, I'd probably just have no numbers at all on it because they're just in the way. because w if people see a remo see the see a remote control without numbers they will think it's very difficult to learn very difficult to very different build very different to the traditional okay, so, I think one of the really kind of useful things you can do with with internet connectivity would be to have this a programme driven interface rather than the channel number.
Okay so while researching this this topic I first of all just thought of a couple of things that I would like to see in a remote, and then also searched for which are the top-rated remote controls on Epinions dot com, which is a a you know a a customer written basically review site. and and this remote control on the right here is is one of the more extravagant, well basically all the functions are controlled through through the L_C_D_ screen But the thing that I find most interesting about this remote control, and it's kind of difficult to to see in the slide, but it has a scroll wheel on it, I think that a scroll wheel is actually pretty a pretty handy way of of changing the channel. because obviously a lot of this stuff can't be done for twenty five Eu Euro, this is another multi kinda purpose remote control where it's it's it's very simple, the scroll wheel could be used without an L_C_D_ screen, just for changing channel numbers easily. and maybe we wanna make it something that's extensible to do other tasks. Then you say potentially you can then do other cool stuff like change the lights, I dunno, close the windows, whatever, turn the heating on,
and so they wanted so they want to they would like to be restricted to T_V_.
and you have to go through a trend watching.
you have to work on user interface,
we need to have remote control which is fanc fancy, which is which is easy to to hand not too small, not too big. We should bring new technologies for young peoples, So so my feeling is that re regarding costs budget we have an an an target price, it's not possible to go s to go to L_C_D_ and also to go to automatic speech recognition technologies. well, could we fit the the targets in terms of cost if we go s to L_C_D_ on the remote control? For twenty five Euro? I think it's impossible. because for twenty five Euro I think all we can really do is provide a very basic remote control, So I would I would like to know if there's any chance of of increasing the of increasing the unit price. what would be the goal of putting an L_C_D_ in a remote control? So what would what would appear in the in the L_C_D_? So you could have the name of the programme, you could have the start time you know where it's up to. I think that the speech recognition technology would be cheaper the than the L_C_D_. we don't go for speech recognition technology. The L_C_D_ is still on disc is still open to discussion. But then we should move to another target b because at twenty five Dollars, Can we can we increase the the price point of this remote control? I'm no I'm definit definitely not keen on going to speech recognition technologies. so you have to work on the component concept. you have to work on user interface, and you have to go through a trend watching.
So I would I would like to know if there's any chance of of increasing the of increasing the unit price. But then we should move to another target b because at twenty five Dollars, Can we can we increase the the price point of this remote control?
so you have to work on the component concept.
and also to go to automatic speech recognition technologies. we don't go for speech recognition technology.
We should bring new technologies for young peoples,
we need to have remote control which is fanc fancy, which is which is easy to to hand not too small, not too big.
well, could we fit the the targets in terms of cost if we go s to L_C_D_ on the remote control? The L_C_D_ is still on disc is still open to discussion. So the question is still open about the L_C_D_ thing.
and finally, it should be clear that the corporate image, that means colours and logos of the co our company should be clearly inde identified in the product.
So you're having the basis station and there is a button, if you press that button wherever the remote it'll start beeping so you know where the remote is. I think that's a pretty handy feature. Yeah but I'm a bit worried about the budget. basis station is nothing more, just it's a wire which is coming from the main cable and you're having one socket on which the thing sits.
Then there are different kind of chips, one one is the basic chip and the regular chip and one an adva advanced chip. Pricing is a factor for us, that's why we'll go for the regular chip.
So we need to take some de decisions about about what we're going to do. We'll have a base station extra on the side. So we that means we need a button on th on the on the basis., we have a R_F_ for for beeping for beeping. and your tur turbo turbo button. Yeah, which I think it's it's probably best actually on the on the underneath of the the device, And and you have two wheels. Oh we need a we need a power on off switch as well.
I'm just wondering actually, 'cause, you know, I this whole fruit thing with the banana, it's it seemed like it first seems a bit kind of niche, like only a few people would really want a banana, but what if it was kind of a stylised banana? You know, rather than having it kind of you know yellow and really looking exactly like a banana, you could make it kind of silver. If you make something that looks like a banana it should have the colour of a banana. maybe like still in the shape of a banana., but you know, just maybe maybe not exactly the same texture as a banana
but are we set on the banana idea? the shape of a banana is not it's not really handy. Yes it is. Yeah, okay, so capsicum or pepper. Yeah. I don't know, it seems a little bit kind of bulky to me, like But like a banana you can you can be holding like this and have the scroll wheel kind of on top
and then it should be double curve. The s science for the ease of handling and there are some other issues why we need double curve. with plastic you can have double curve but with certain other materials we cannot have double curve.
Marketing Expert have to go to product evaluation.
You have to work on the look and feel design and you have to work on the user interface, in fact you two you have to work together to model the first f first prototype.
We'll have a base station extra on the side. So we that means we need a button on th on the on the basis. and your tur turbo turbo button. Yeah, which I think it's it's probably best actually on the on the underneath of the the device, And and you have two wheels. Oh we need a we need a power on off switch as well.
So this is out of discussion. I think it doesn't really add much to the functional design and it's it's it's not mature enough to use as a speech recognition engine, so So i it looks like we're going completely to forget about the L_C_D_ thing. No we can we can't use that. Well, I f I think it's probably more than, than our can handle because it's designed for a coffee machine, you know, to say hello in the morning. L_C_D_ has already been ruled out, A_S_R_ has been ruled out.
I investigate deeper the preference of the users. What I found in order of importance from less to more important is that people want an easy to use device. After they they want something new technologic technologically speaking, what they what they find more more interesting, more or more important it's a fancy look and feel instead of instead of the current the current trend which was f the functional look and feel. So now more more cool aspect, ma more a cooler aspect rather than a device with many functions and many buttons with instead of i instead of ha of a device which can do many things, a device which is pleasant to to watch, to see. all this fashion it's it's fruit and the the the theme is fruit and vegetables. And also in the in the U_S_A_ the the current the mor the most popular feeling it's it's a spongy. What what do you mean by fruit and vegetables and spongy? I didn't miss and I saw that the fruit, there are many fr pictures of fruits and vegetables in the clothes.
So we're not gonna have a remote control in the shape of of a banana, Vegetable textures and all this kind. So which fruit are you thinking of? I ha I haven't thought of any particular fruit, but the general aspect of the of the remote control may may could remind some kind of vegetable, instead of vegetable, some natur natural object or something. or you want just some kind of like fruit logo on the No, not n not not too much focus, not too much focu not n not too s not too similar to a fruit because next year the ten the trend the trend will be different. I'm not, I'm not really sure if that would really appeal to everyone though, like maybe just like a little bit n a little fruit picture somewhere in the corner, Is fruit cool? Okay, but it has to be easy to to use though and to hold you know, Well, probably the only thing is a banana that I can think of, a cucumber. Maybe too long. and you you you will not have pla enough a lot of place to put a L_C_D_ on a banana also. and also it's I'm not convinced about this L_C_D_ do you want a an L_C_D_ with twenty five Euros?
you're simply looking s to a remote control that looks like a banana with few buttons with only a few buttons.
So you are User Interface guy.
Okay. So I received an email around lunchtime letting me know that the brilliant minds at our technology division had developed an integrated programmable sample sensor sample speaker unit, It means that it can recognize, it can do like a match on a on a certain phrase that you speak and then can play back a phrase in response to that. Is this a technology that recognize keywords speech keywords? it's it'll recognize I guess keywords, but you know keywords in a certain order like a phrase. So this is not s really to do to to do control. It's designed it's designed as a fun kind of thing, yeah comp completely pointless for the inter for from the interaction point of v point of view.
I guess you could build that in, you could you could link the the recognition of a certain phrase to some function on on the remote control. but it basically means we c we can kind of consider this from you know a theoretical or usability kind of viewpoint without worrying too much about you know how to develop it because we have this already done.
I've also included this turbo button because I think, you know, every design should have a turbo button, so with this turbo button you can, say, skip over t channels if, you know, if I'm if I'm going if I'm scrolling past them
But, I've just indicated here, we could have actually two scroll wheels, But I think it's important, you know, to have two scroll wheels because, you know, you want one for for the channel, but you also want one for for the volume,
It might be useful to have some kind of base station, even if it's just you press on a button on it and and the remote control starts beeping, you know, this is a way of finding the remote.
So i it looks like we're going completely to forget about the L_C_D_ thing.
but are we set on the banana idea?
So today is our third meeting. It will be about the conceptual design.
. We decided not to go for speech recognition technologies because of some reasons and we are not decided about u the use of L_C_D_ screen on on the remote control because of costs. at the end of the meeting we should take decision on that point.
I've just done a quick mock-up of some of the features of our potential funky-looking remote control but I mean we can discuss about what other kind of buttons we need,. it's just you know a couple of scroll wheels and a button cause it's hard to get so many buttons on a banana well, I guess you need an on and off switch, but you could you could o you could turn it turn it on by taking the top off the banana maybe, you know,
So each of you have some presentatio presentation to perform
Well, I dunno if the traditional user is gonna buy a a banana remote But you know our targets are very high, means fifty million Euros is the profit which we want make.
but plastic is I think is the most appropriate one, it'll bring the cost down Yeah but it's more easier to do a banana in plastic than in wood.
So this is going to be about the component design. So first thing is we need power source for the remote control.
Then we need plastic with some elasticity so that if your if the remote control falls it's not broken directly into pieces, I guess that fits in with the spongy kind of design philosophy.
So I was of the idea that we can have two kind of power supplies, one is the usual batteries which are there, they could be chargeable batteries if there's a basis station kind of thing and on top of that we can have solar cells, when the lighting conditions are good they can be used so it'll be pretty innovative kind.
So final design. Final design. well first first of all we made a an attractive base station with a banana leaf look and feel and the banana sits in there k you know nicely weighted so that it's not gonna tip over We've got the two scroll wheels here which you know one on the the left for the volume and the one on the right for for the channel and underneath we have the the turbo button What's the use of the t turbo button already? This is when you when you are scrolling the through the channels you can tell it to to skip th past channels that you quickly rather th Well when you stop scrolling the wheel it stops. If you take the banana as such and you press the turbo button, so it switch ons the switch ons the T_V_. once you press the teletext button then the scroll buttons they are more for teletext, they are no more for channel or vol volume. And this is the the infrared port. in the in the base station we have the the button at the front for for calling the the banana. And the the leaves plays the roles of of antennas? And for the power source we are having solar cells and rechargeable batteries and this and the basis station is going to have the input from the power line for for charging the batteries. And we have put these different colours so that people don't mistake them mistake it as a banana. It's it's it's about the weight of a banana. I don't really know if the solar cells are actually necessary any more if you have a recharging base station. I mean how long does i how how how long can it be held off a station? No eight or eight or ten hours of working. If you are just leaving like that it'll be much longer. Pricing is was a factor so that's why we have gone for a regular chip only not the advanced chip. And what about people who want to
just going to go quickly through the minutes of the last last meeting then we have a p presentation of prototype of you two, No L_C_D_, no speech recognition technology, okay, we went through a b to a banana look and feel for the remote control. And also the use of a basis station for battery ch charging and also to call the to call the mot mote remote control when it is lost.
And this is the the infrared port. in the in the base station we have the the button at the front for for calling the the banana.
which you know one on the the left for the volume and the one on the right for for the channel
Pricing is was a factor so that's why we have gone for a regular chip only not the advanced chip. Well we decided against the solar cells so I think rechargeable batteries will take care of the power thing. So we have the regular chip on the print, which is one. I put single curved. To reduce the cost, it's okay. Okay it's gonna have to be plastic. So I mean if we're if we're over budget then maybe we could we could rethink that. but you know the turbo button does add that extra class. Make it plastic instead of rubber.
This is a teletext button. once you press the teletext button then the scroll buttons they are more for teletext, they are no more for channel or vol volume.
I put single curved. To reduce the cost, it's okay.
well first first of all we made a an attractive base station with a banana leaf look and feel and
Pricing is was a factor so that's why we have gone for a regular chip only not the advanced chip. So we have the regular chip on the print, which is one.
I put single curved. To reduce the cost, it's okay. So I mean if we're if we're over budget then maybe we could we could rethink that.
So we have the regular chip on the print, which is one. So we stick to plastic, it cost nothing. Too expensive. Well no didn't we say we wanted to do a rubber Okay so special colour, yellow. We have three. We have two scroll, and we have three push buttons. Okay it's gonna have to be plastic. Make it plastic instead of rubber.
So we can go to through to project evaluation. No we have a product which none of us would buy. Okay so project process. Well in fact I I did not know I didn't know really what to say here. Yeah well in fact we we use a little bit the white board and the digital pen, not that much. I dunno I think we had a fair bit of creativity. And but I think one thing we m missed out of this whole process was a like a focus group with the actual people we're targeting. Yeah maybe we should go through, yeah an evaluation. Because yeah the evaluation for us is is kind of pointless. So but I think that's something we need to to work on next time is really finding out more about the target market. I think that's actually something that should be in version two, is the ability to you know to control things other than the T_V_ I think we we can go Okay so thanks very much.
Okay let's let's evaluate if it's fancy or Yeah, it's fancy, according to me. Seven. Seven by me. Yeah five. but maybe loses the point for not having you know the extra buttons when you reall if you do need them for some reason like I'd I think it's probably more handy than my current remote, 'cause of the scroll wheels Functional. I'll give five. Well it depends when you say functional, do you mean it does what we want it to do, or d does what it does, you know, can it make you coffee? Actually I don't know what are the r the real specification of a of a universal remote contro Well it's not a universal remote. Four. Okay cool? Cool device. There I'll give it seven. For a T_V_ the most important feature which I felt was the locator which is a cool feature. I would say five. I say I said seven. Of course I'll buy the banana. I'll say five. I find it quite cheap actually. I dunno. If i i it depends, if you live in in Switzerland or you live in Wha the initial specifications were for the whole all Europe or I don't want a banana on my living room table, a banana remote. Anyb anybody who comes here anybody who comes to your home he'll at least ask once what is this. don't forget who we're targeting also No, it's I. I would buy I don't think I at any stage in my life I would want a banana remote control, really. So you say two. I say five. If I had t if I had to spend twenty five Euro, if that was like my limit, maybe I would buy it. I stick to five. will I change my rem change my remote control from Mando banana. No let's say I'll put two. If it was change my remote control of my D_V_D_ player for a Mando banana then I would be more inclined to I'd say a three. So it's somewhere three point five I think. So maybe maybe
We have three.
No eight or eight or ten hours of working. If you are just leaving like that it'll be much longer. I don't really know if the solar cells are actually necessary any more if you have a recharging base station. Well we decided against the solar cells so I think rechargeable batteries will take care of the power thing.
So we have to go through now evaluations. I constructed a a list of criteria based on the on the general user requirements. so we must users must say i if it's true or is or if it's false in a in a scale ranging from zero to seven. Why this strange factor of seven? Because it should be an even it should be an even scale, I think I sh I I could write the criteria in the on the whiteboard?
It's it's it's about the weight of a banana. And we have put these different colours so that people don't mistake them mistake it as a banana.
Well we decided against the solar cells so I think rechargeable batteries will take care of the power thing.
well we are going to calculate the production costs. We should we should be below twelve point five. No kinetic also. Oh there is no listing for r radio frequency thing. So we we'll put some extras, if there is something. we're just using the the very beep simple beep, Well actually that that no that sample speaker is not we we're not using that, And we have sample speaker. Yeah well pl the base station is made out of m many units of plastic. So might be ninety centimes for the the remaining things which the cord and everything which'll go so we have margin for that stuff.
And we are trying to to have a market all around the world.
We expect a production cost of maximum twelve point fifty Euro.
, so we can start today to have a first idea of what we want to do what are our experiments with remote control, and any idea? Well, from experience, I've had remote controls in the past that have had very they've had lots and lots of buttons and they've been very small, and it's been very hard to to to use, because there's so many buttons, you know, on a T_V_ remote you only ever use, mostly, you know, f four or f six buttons.. first would be that in current remote controls there is no back light, so if you are if you are playing with this in the dark room it's it's probably worth to to have something like back light. And the second thing, f second point from me would be that in a normal remote control there is there are two buttons for volume control. But I prefer like a potential-meter or something like. Are you not afraid that if you take your remote control you can move the slide and it could the the volume can go up very quickly Yeah but we can we can think of these things afterwards, I I prefer remote control working with radio waves, because remote control working with infra-red rays you should you should you should keep it in a specific direction and then try it hard to tune.
the the interface interface developer will work on the on the design of the remote control,
you are going to try to to find the user requirements f for the remote control.
we are going to to sell we want to sell this remote control for twenty five Euro Euro.
, we are actually doing this meeting to start a new project which is about designing a remote control. So I'm going to be the project manager of this project. I'm Fabien Cardinaux and I I guess you can present yourself. so my name is Petre., in the project I'm supposed to be the technic. 'Kay. So my name's Bob Morris. I'm the Marketing Expert for this project. My name is Hamed Getabdar, and I'm going to be Interface Designer in this project.
We are talking about the project plan,. So what is the goal of this project? Is to design a new remote control. So it's more like we are going to do inv individual work all in o in o our specialities and we are going to meet each other quite often to discuss and to find a good way. so now we are going to to get used t to to the tools we are going to use all during all this project. For example we can try to write what is our our favourite animal and write the f our favourite characteristics about it. So I will ask you all to do the same. Well sh should I draw the picture of the animal? Yeah, yeah, you can draw the picture, of course.
we are going to to sell we want to sell this remote control for twenty five Euro Euro. And our expected profit will be around fifty million Euro. And we are trying to to have a market all around the world. We expect a production cost of maximum twelve point fifty Euro.
so so we keep all these all these buttons. So we've got channel and volume.. A button is better.
If we if we add the time, we have to have maybe a bigger display or something like that,
so we we could p what we could probably do is to keep also to keep keep the L_C_D_ and all the buttons and stuff,
We should hide them somewhere.
Probably not. W In my opinion we should have only useful thing
What about things like the clock and timers? If we if we add the time, we have to have maybe a bigger display or something like that, I mean, are users wants to have the time on the on the remote? Probably not. W In my opinion we should have only useful thing
Because of the internet popularity and everybody has internet at home, and actually it's not useful to have teletext.
the second thing is they suggest that that we should use the remote control only for T_V_, not for D_V_D_ and other devices,
So I have to inform you I receive an email from the management bon board today and they have new requirements for the for the remote control. Because of the internet popularity and everybody has internet at home, and actually it's not useful to have teletext. the second thing is they suggest that that we should use the remote control only for T_V_, not for D_V_D_ and other devices, the third one is about the the the image of the company. It's That mean we should use the colour of our company So we should we should keep The the product should be recognisable. and maybe put somewhere the s the slogan of the company, which is, we put fashion of in electronics. So now we we should take the decision what we are going to what function we will have on this on this remote control. Well, should we start with just the core, the basic functions that we need. And then we can move on to the more advanced features. I think we should stick on very useful functions, because we want less button. So, turning channel, of course. Volume setting. Because it's many buttons and we were speaking about lowering the number. will we use only two buttons, or or like numbered buttons? Maybe we could have key buttons, like discovery channe like documentary channel, and movies channel and so so we keep all these all these buttons. If you want to see a movie you click on the movie button so you have all the movie channels and after you've you plus plus plus. So it requires the use of L_C_D_ probably, to to tell you We could maybe also c incorporate Petre's idea of the slider for the volume, with the channel. I mean there's always we can always have these l less often used functions hidden somewhere, We should hide them somewhere. I mean a power button's obviously required., well I think when they say power button they mean to turn the T_V_ on and off. Should should shouldn't we do it like sleep mode
So we should we should keep The the product should be recognisable. It's That mean we should use the colour of our company and maybe put somewhere the s the slogan of the company, which is, we put fashion of in electronics. the third one is about the the the image of the company.
I mean there's always we can always have these l less often used functions hidden somewhere,
This I was thinking. Do we need a power button at all?, well I think when they say power button they mean to turn the T_V_ on and off. Should should shouldn't we do it like sleep mode after five minutes of not using it? Should we make it a button, or some some something which would be A button is better.
Okay, so here is my presentation about technical function design. first is remote control have sh ha should have some electric circuits making interface with keyboard and r reading keyboard and reading the keyboard commands. And then there should be an electronic circuit making electronic signals according to these commands and finally there is a transmitter which is a cord or a a diode making making waves to transmit through the air Okay, about what I found about different these different blocks are, usually there are two different methods to for designing a remote control. They are based on infra-red waves or radio waves. certainly a remote control with working with radio waves is preferred because you can pr you can take it in any direction and you don't need to tune it any way. And again, using bigger buttons and less number of buttons are also preferred, as I see. Do you think radio waves will interfere with other appliances in the home?, I don't think so, And what happen with radio waves when two neighbours have the same have our remote control, for example? but one solution can be something like putting p password or something inside the wave, so the only your T_V_ can understand it
And speech recognition in remote unit, it will be very e expensive. But the speech recognition we have to compare whether the price and the what does it offer, you know. If we decide to use the speech recognition, then we probably could struggle
Do you think radio waves will interfere with other appliances in the home?, I don't think so, And what happen with radio waves when two neighbours have the same have our remote control, for example?
I have only a couple of things because I had I struggled a bit with the software that I'm supposed to use in this in this company. so I have to look what what is a v a v available on the market for for the communication for the I_R_ circuits and so on, And I wanted to ask you m maybe afterwards, after after our discussion, if we have some contacts in some companies, so, which can report on what is going on there, So, I know that the user interface people and these speak about radio frequency waves but you know, when you are not close to the T_V_ you probably won't need to to change the program and so on and so I am I am voting for s to stick to the infra-red control instead of R_W_ well, L_C_D_ it's okay because it's common nowadays to use L_C_D_, But the speech recognition we have to compare whether the price and the what does it offer, you know. And my personal preference is yes, I would like also preferably to use R_W_ circuit, but from the point of view of the design and price, I would stick to I_R_s.
Tod for this meeting I will take the notes and do the minutes. so we will see our three presentations. we will start with the Manager Expert wi who will talk about user re requirements, whats user needs and what it desire for this devi device. Okay, so basically I'm gonna present some findings of a study we conducted into what users want in this remote control. So basically the major things we found out was that basically users don't like the look and feel of of most remote controls that are currently on the market. seventy five percent of the people we we did the experiments on, found that rem remote the remote controls that they'd used in the past were ugly. they they didn't match the operating behaviour of the user, and thirdly they say that w half of the users that we tested said that they only used ten percent of the buttons that are on remote controls. And from this we basically came up with the figure that the channel buttons, the channel selection buttons are the most by far the most used buttons on the remote control. And basically they came they said the channel, volume, and power buttons had the highest relevance to users, And fifty percent of the users said that what frustrates them is losing the remote control somewhere in the room and not being able to find it.
And the price is fairly cheap for this.
In particular, do they want an L_C_D_ d display, and secondly, do they think speech recognition is a useful feature to have on a remote control. basically our findings are that amongst a younger age groups the answer is umv overwhelmingly yes. So I guess it depends on where we're focusing our our market.
will we use only two buttons, or or like numbered buttons? Because it's many buttons and we were speaking about lowering the number.
I think you should work together, s you Hamed and Peter, to work in a in a first prototype,
And the the Marketing Expert will do the first project evaluation.
The User Interface Mana Manager will work on the user interface device.
So, the more frequent buttons should be larger, they should be placed in a good position inside the remote control. so we can cover these buttons which are not used or number buttons for the for the for the can channels,. And also I think if we put some some some some some buttons inside of the remote control it can be used easier.
Okay. So I am going to talk about a little bit about how this remote control should be appear to be more easy to use. generally, generally this remote control should be should be something, in my opinion, the first feature is just to be easy to use. And s I can conclude like this, that we shouldn't need to learn how to use it. they should be placed in a good position inside the remote control. So, the more frequent buttons should be larger, the shape of remote control should be in a way which can which should be taken easily in hand. And also f m because because customers doesn't like to buy lots of battery, it should not consume lots of energy. so we can cover these buttons which are not used or number buttons for the for the for the can channels,. And also I think if we put some some some some some buttons inside of the remote control it can be used easier. And I dunno but I think usage of a speech recogn r recogniser can be good. but if we do it in some way that it asleeps when there is no sound and when it detects some sound it may consume less energy.
And also the feel of material this year is expected to be spongy. From our f fashion people in Paris and Milan, we've discovered that this year fruit the fruit and vegetable motif will be the most important thing in in clothes, shoes and furniture. and third thirdly the easiness of use is is the is is important as well, Secondly that our remote control needs to be techn technologically innovative. so f from our market research basically we've come to the conclusion that a fancy look and feel, as opposed to a functional look and feel, is our number one priority. I think the biggest struggle will be the easy to use feature.
Okay. so basically I just want to presented to you present to you some recent results we've had from looking at some remote control market research and some fashion trends around the world. so f from our market research basically we've come to the conclusion that a fancy look and feel, as opposed to a functional look and feel, is our number one priority. and third thirdly the easiness of use is is the is is important as well, Secondly that our remote control needs to be techn technologically innovative. From our f fashion people in Paris and Milan, we've discovered that this year fruit the fruit and vegetable motif will be the most important thing in in clothes, shoes and furniture. And also the feel of material this year is expected to be spongy.
the goal of this meeting is to reach a decision at the end on the concept and I think the last time we talked about an a lot and we had a rough idea of what is going to be,
should should discover the other buttons, which are hidden. Yeah, peeling of the banana. Is it is it possible to do that? If you see it's like peeling. You open a plastic cover and you see some U_S_B_ interfaces, some some interfaces for adaptor.
I dunno if it can fit with the technology. The screen has to be square? But if you want some shape then we can only get like two screens out of seven to seven inches, so. It's like more more expensive to have shape like that. I think that's more important than saving a bit of money on on the T_F_T_ screen.
My first idea is because our colour is more yellow, and the it should be easy to take in a hand, I thought about banana, or something like that, which is fruits, and Well it's it's definitely the obvious choice, with the colour of our company. I dunno if it can fit with the technology. Is it is it possible to do that? If you see it's like peeling. You open a plastic cover and you see some U_S_B_ interfaces, some some interfaces for adaptor.
, so the the Industrial Manager will will work on the look and feel design.
first I think energy it's a key problem so I think we have to do some work to finalise our idea and take decisions. If we use the batteries, and the additional so solar cell, then it's okay for L_ speech recognition and L_C_D_, so no problem in energy, I think. I think seven centimetre by seven centimetre is a little bit large. Could you re could you redesign your board? I've I s I think the easiest thing would be to to have a smaller L_C_D_, if it's possible. Okay, so five to ten, I I think it's it's feasible. So using some L_C_D_s we can touch, so we can remove keys and just having, I dunno the name, L_C_D_ responding to fingers. So let's go for a small L_C_D_. My first idea is because our colour is more yellow, and the it should be easy to take in a hand, I thought about banana, or something like that, which is fruits, and Well it's it's definitely the obvious choice, with the colour of our company. I dunno if it can fit with the technology. The screen has to be square? But if you want some shape then we can only get like two screens out of seven to seven inches, so. So we are agree with the banana thing? It's like more more expensive to have shape like that. I think that's more important than saving a bit of money on on the T_F_T_ screen. So, the last point we decided it's infra-red, I guess. should should discover the other buttons, which are hidden. Yeah, peeling of the banana. Is it is it possible to do that? I think if we if we have a spongy layer on the outside of the banana then it's easy to make that, If you see it's like peeling. You open a plastic cover and you see some U_S_B_ interfaces, some some interfaces for adaptor. it can be a plastic cover sticking to the to the all the stuff like with magnetic p magnetic magnetic materials in the border, so it's it sticks
that our company developed a s a seven f seven fingers seven seven inch T_ T_F_T_ screen, which is good news for us, since we wanted to include a display there. And if we decide to use the speech recognition stuff there, we must use additional source of energy, which I found the best is to use the solar cells which can which can supply everything. Can you fit any for example a T_F_T_ or any electronic device in a spongy thing, or is there any problem for that? A all these things in in in this box are okay to put in in any shape, basically. Well, sponginess. Maybe it a good feature, since it takes if it's around the T_F_T_ then it's good, because it's just keeps it safe,
that our company developed a s a seven f seven fingers seven seven inch T_ T_F_T_ screen, which is good news for us, since we wanted to include a display there. So there will be some circuit for the power. the main energy will be taken from batteries And if we decide to use the speech recognition stuff there, we must use additional source of energy, which I found the best is to use the solar cells which can which can supply everything. the main board with all the circuits will take at least seven to seven centimetres, And on the main board we have the interface to the microphone, which is somewhere,
Seven to seven to at least well some three millimetres or something. Even from my perspective seven t seven centimetres by seven centimetres is still Yeah, but we wanted the big buttons and stuff like that, you know. I thought that it it should fit in the hand or something. I think seven centimetre by seven centimetre is a little bit large. Could you re could you redesign your board? Okay, so five to ten, I I think it's it's feasible.
So if we use s solar cells, where is the sun if someone's watching T_V_ inside?
have we decided that we're gonna use this T_F_T_ screen? how big is it in reality? Usually when they say seven inch I think it's the diagonal. But I I think we can we can cut it. So so for the same price we have four screens now.
So we add also the speech recognition device.
should should discover the other buttons, which are hidden. I think if we if we have a spongy layer on the outside of the banana then it's easy to make that,
If we use the batteries, and the additional so solar cell, then it's okay for L_ speech recognition and L_C_D_, I think if we if we have a spongy layer on the outside of the banana then it's easy to make that,
So, the last point we decided it's infra-red, I guess.
So we are agree with the banana thing?
So using some L_C_D_s we can touch, so we can remove keys and just having, I dunno the name, L_C_D_ responding to fingers.
I've I s I think the easiest thing would be to to have a smaller L_C_D_, if it's possible. So let's go for a small L_C_D_.
So. Twenty five Euro for a remote control.
for a production cost of twelve fifty Euros maximum.
maybe we can change the colours that at least the frame. Maybe I think even we can keep two switches and then we can only make one working. and if I'm left-hander I use this switch to follow the main operations.
Go back button is good.
Remote controls children proof.
No, that's a good idea. colourful, maybe Yeah even we can change colours, no? like the phones and these things we c yeah.
, so let's try the whiteboard. so any of you who want to go. It's gonna be not my favourite one but the one I can draw.
and if I'm left-hander I use this switch to follow the main operations. may need more than three three button, three possibilities, ye yeah. But for standard actions you usually what do you do, you change channels, you adjust volume, and nothing else. but for instance when you change channels you can have you can just go to the next one or go to channel twenty five. But they keep generally their t slash slash this thing and then the dash dash and then you can put yeah, you can only have one bit.
We're here to have a kick-off meeting for the design of a f for the beginning of new project remote control for the design for a new remote control. and we speak about this tool we're going to design and try to make a project plan, I think the important points we have to t talk about are it's functional design, it's conceptual design, and desail detailed design. and for that we're going all to work individually and then have meeting during the whole day.
And it should be really small and. Small also? at least it should hold in your hand n properly, like.
no screens, it's too complex.. So, some kind of idea with cellular phone with a a screen that will tell you what Too expensive for twelve Euro?
And m maybe more in the technical parts what do we want to do.
and I want you to work on these ideas and try to make a the ones, make to decide what what are the ones important and what are the one that we don't want.
we're going to meet again in thirty minutes and I want you to work on these ideas and try to make a the ones, make to decide what what are the ones important and what are the one that we don't want. And m maybe more in the technical parts what do we want to do. So your personal coach will send you some instruction for for this thirty minutes. So what does M_E_ means? Market Expert. that's me. the user requirement specifications,
So that could be a great application. Remote controls children proof. but mainly it has to be very robust colourful, maybe No, that's a good idea. Yeah even we can change colours, no? like the phones and these things we c yeah. And it should be really small and. Small also? Should it be, y you know these remote controls where they are what they call a universal ret remote control at least it should hold in your hand n properly, like. maybe we can change the colours that at least the frame. I think one thing important for instance in this remote control if you remember when people use it they're they never find a good button in the right place. no screens, it's too complex.. So, some kind of idea with cellular phone with a a screen that will tell you what Too expensive for twelve Euro? Maybe I think even we can keep two switches and then we can only make one working. and if I'm left-hander I use this switch to follow the main operations. may need more than three three button, three possibilities, ye yeah. But for standard actions you usually what do you do, you change channels, you adjust volume, and nothing else. but for instance when you change channels you can have you can just go to the next one or go to channel twenty five. But they keep generally their t slash slash this thing and then the dash dash and then you can put yeah, you can only have one bit. And then back to the one I was before, yeah, that would be cool. Go back button is good.
So any of you have experience in remote controls? So that could be a great application. Remote controls children proof. but mainly it has to be very robust colourful, maybe No, that's a good idea. Yeah even we can change colours, no? like the phones and these things we c yeah. And it should be really small and. Small also? Should it be, y you know these remote controls where they are what they call a universal ret remote control at least it should hold in your hand n properly, like. maybe we can change the colours that at least the frame. I think one thing important for instance in this remote control if you remember when people use it they're they never find a good button in the right place. no screens, it's too complex.. So, some kind of idea with cellular phone with a a screen that will tell you what Too expensive for twelve Euro? Maybe I think even we can keep two switches and then we can only make one working. and if I'm left-hander I use this switch to follow the main operations. may need more than three three button, three possibilities, ye yeah. But for standard actions you usually what do you do, you change channels, you adjust volume, and nothing else. but for instance when you change channels you can have you can just go to the next one or go to channel twenty five. But they keep generally their t slash slash this thing and then the dash dash and then you can put yeah, you can only have one bit. And then back to the one I was before, yeah, that would be cool. Go back button is good.
Yeah, we're to sell two million then. On the international market.
Let's talk about money. So. Twenty five Euro for a remote control. On the international market. Yeah, we're to sell two million then. for a production cost of twelve fifty Euros maximum.
Like, you want to find it, you shout and it answers is I'm here? Or But that's ex that's expensive.. Just beeps? I I heard of devices where you just whistle them because of the the frequency they they just answer to that. You can clap. Can you?
we can have another, like s simple speech recogniser on our D_S_B_ chip. you can find even simple mobile device like any mobile brand you can have these voice dialers or these things, yeah. because we have only very few words like like power, switch on or some like The user will just be able to say please can you pump up the vo pump up the volume or or it will be something like volume, up, down. so we try to only recognise those words and and because we can't really say user to say same wording
Think of a all these young people who would love to say that this remote control only works for them, So in in a given room there might be more than one remote control. We would have each one and with our own personal settings.
I hope you're ready for this functional design meeting. I will take the minutes you you three are going to do presentation. we want to know to at the end to know the new project's requirement we need to know the the user needs we want to know how it going to work third part I don't remember let's go for the three presentations,
but i like we talk about universal remote control. I think we will only concentrate on T_V_ for the moment and then maybe m make it more generalised yeah.
You know these days we have hundreds of channels, for instance if I want to go to directly to channel twenty five, how would I do can I do that with this? Basically you use just four or five channels, One thing is that as I said in my presentation people really do like to z zap. So even if they are only watching four or five channels, I think they want to zap out of the one hundred channels,
So we've listed a couple of Functions. that may be used by u the user in the current available remote controls but what is important is to understand that the power button is not used often because in general you use it only once per session, but it is very relevant. People want to have a power button. Channel selection is o often used very often used Volume is not often used but people want to have control on volume And n then you have things which are very much less often used like the settings. Audio settings, screen settings, even teletext and channel settings. All of them. they're not often used and they are s more or less relevant. It seems that people find teletext teletext relevant, but seems that it's average relevant at least, so. I have been told that we don't consider teletext, that it's out of date now because of internet. if if there are good reason not to put teletext it's okay One of the thing the trend that you are probably aware of is the possibility the eventual possibility of having speech recognition in your remote control, so you wouldn't have to tap tap in your buttons but just tell your remote control or whatever you need you have what you want. So we've conducted a survey about whether people would like or not to have this kind of functionality in their remote control and as we can see it really depends on the age. Young people, probably because it's a buzz word, find it very relevant. And as the age goes up the the relevance goes down. So now it really depends on the kind of targeting wha who are we targeting with this remote control? I think if we are targeting young people then it's probably something we have to consider. If we are targeting you very old people this is something they really don't know why they this should be so that's basically my findings. should we aim at the young people or not? I think we should aim at the young
Since we were targeting a really soon date for the the the i issuing of this remote control I think we will only concentrate on T_V_ for the moment and then maybe m make it more generalised yeah. And we have maybe we have to we say, only for T_V_, not teletext?
so first Marketing Expert. So as you know, you I think you already know me, Sammy Benjo. I am the expert in marketing and I want to tell you about what people s want and like and dislike in remote controls, what I suggest is that instead of deciding ourself what what could be and what should be a good remote control, let's ask people who are users of remote controls what they like, what they don't like So we've we've conducted a a survey on on the use of remote controls what we found was that there are several things that the user don't like in remote controls. First of all, they find it very ugly. they're not nice colour, not nice shape, I mean they're all the same, what is interesting is that in fact it seems that they were people are ready to pay for nice and look and fancy looking remote control, so I think we should probably spend lots of time in and effort in that. and it it the the current facilities that they offer do not match what people really want to use their remote controls. And the other thing is that the the current remote controls are not so easy to use For instance we see that they zap very often so I think this is a very important functionality And most of the buttons on current remote controls are not used, so I think we should design something where some of the buttons which are those that are used should be easier to see and use than others that only a couple of people are using. people are very frustrated w with their remote controls and they for instance they don't even find it it's it's often lost somewhere in the in the in your home Maybe if we have something where we could ask the remote control please, where are you? Like something to to like t I think phones. Some of the phones have some of this kind of s functionality. And because of the fact that there are so
even automatic on off is also a bit problematic, I think automatic on off control it's not possible.
I have been told that we don't consider teletext, that it's out of date now because of internet. And we have maybe we have to we say, only for T_V_, not teletext?
and our m Market Expert Sammy Benjo on the trend watching.
of course the U_I_D_ Mark will be focused on the user interface concept
as you know, I am mister Ramaro. I am an expert in industrial design of all electronic devices So now I'll briefly describe the working design of our remote control. as you know the basic function of remote control is sending some message to the the device, like T_V_ or V_C_R_ or D_V_D_ player etcetera. So we need to have some energy source to do what to do the functions, what we want on this portable device. so to do these functions we need an interface, which basically some kind of pressing buttons or keys or like moving jack or something like that. And then these messages these key buttons can be transferred into some kind of message and then it will process by the chip and then it will generate some information to the main device. since we are focusing on our interface device remote control mainly the energy source like the battery and then we have user interface like the keypad and you know buttons we want, we ought to have some kind of processor And then we'll have the infrared L_E_D_ source Then we'll have switch in our main device to do particular operations, and we ought to do different codes for different T_V_s, To make it quite an universal device. because the people don't use one particular brand so So we need to check their specifications So we need to have particular encryption codes. so I'll input the connections to all this components. so if you want to add some more components we can incorporate them. Mm-hmm. And from from the discussion we had do you can you make it on the whiteboard, or. and also Marketing Expert for the speech recognition is really handy, we can have another, like s simple speech recogniser on our D_S_B_ chip. and we can have some speech recognition and in our g generally small digital signal processing chip so that and we will put the small simple speech recogniser you can find even simple mobile device like any mobile brand you can have these voice dialers or these things, yeah
my name is Mark Dwight, and I am responsible for User Interface Design. However, Project Manager asked me to give you some presentation about technical functions design. that's gonna be less technical functions but more User Interface and current intentions and everything which is linked with this. And a general method which is seems to be very useful for our task We should never complicate things too much. We should only make a remote control, nothing more. Nothing more than this, just a remote control. 'Cause current remote controls they are never easy enough to use. So here is this remote control. It's quite a standard one, but it's not from a T_V_, it's from a much easier device like air conditioning or something. But you know, we can use it for a T_V_ easily. Only buttons we need is on off, volume, channels and maybe some options or something else, I would say the simplest one as long as there are the I find the buttons that I need every time I need a button. Maybe it can be yeah middle of like, between those two compared to this one Our question of the style, we should remember that our company puts fashion into electronics For personal preferences I think that to make a baby-proof remote control it got to be a titanium. It is unbreakable and it is very universal. W we'll have a screen with a back light which can change colours, and we can put all the options into this screen. We'll need only few buttons. All the other things can be controlled through the screen. And all these buttons should be easy to find and to click, I would propose this concept for design, just few buttons, a screen with a back light which can change colours, titanium We need power and volume. And let us include two nice features into this device, first, power on and off can be made fully automatic. When you go to the sofa, take your control and point it to the T_V_, the T_V_ turns on. And when does it
you will focus on the component concept
we're now going to l have the lunch break. Then we will work again for thirty minutes individual work, and we will meet again for the next meeting, and in this one want to to be more focused on the individual actions the on the components you will focus on the component concept of course the U_I_D_ Mark will be focused on the user interface concept and our m Market Expert Sammy Benjo on the trend watching. of course like before specific instruction will be sent to you by your personal personal coach. And we have maybe we have to we say, only for T_V_, not teletext? I think automatic on off control it's not possible. But speech recogniser can be possible., should it be equipped with the, with speakers? Like, you want to find it, you shout and it answers is I'm here? Or But that's ex that's expensive.. Just beeps? I I heard of devices where you just whistle them because of the the frequency they they just answer to that. You can clap. Can you? But it's a good feature I guess yeah
and we just stick with two batteries
I think it's what we say, that we have an an L_C_D_ with information.
But it would be expensive, no? If you use colour L_C_D_. if users want more colours they can pay more money to get this the shapes and they can have different assembly. instead of that maybe we can change the colour of the assembler. you you propose something with option i that increase the price if we if you want o more colours on L_C_D_, I think I think they would be ready p ready to pay more for that. It might be optional, yeah.
Do you think it can come in several colours? I would make a backlight of the L_C_D_ screen with different colours. but not the case. the case would only be in that aluminium titanium stuff, Because apparently from your survey people like colours, let's remember there's a Nokia phone which changeable panels. so that would be the option But it would be expensive, no? If you use colour L_C_D_. instead of that maybe we can change the colour of the assembler. if users want more colours they can pay more money to get this the shapes and they can have different assembly. you you propose something with option i that increase the price if we if you want o more colours on L_C_D_, there's one more decisi one more solution in fact, 'cause there are some some paints that can change colour according to where they are, like they can reflect different colours depending on what is around, like what colour is around, and depending on the temperature, but that's maybe mo too much expensive, yeah.
But full assembly We'll use mainly for titanium And also we want to go for titanium design instead of rubber or the problem is with this design we found that we can't use double-curved shapes. So maybe titanium it's not a good idea. because it's what is probably more feasible in terms of sponginess. I think the rubber aspect might be important If if it's something like rubber made or I think it it's also going to be good. Maybe we can have two different assembly also like one spongy and one kind of titanium. you explore now that you're going to work together these these two.
but how smart should it be to not to complicate things too much? Are are you saying here that the remote controls should be aware of who is using it? I just want to say it should be real smart. since we have we want to do some speaker dependent speech recognition so we can use So it could be smart in that way. it might also record the kind of channels you are u more often using and levels of volumes that you're more often things like that The remote that knows you.
I want to know why it b just sorry but for the point before why not the rubber, if it is something that it seems to be light. W we can use something like you know the whole body's titanium but there are some rubber or I dunno some rubber parts we want to follow general trend. No, we don't have to, Again, as I said we can also try to make it, to create the trend. are we confident enough on creating trends?
Do you think it can come in several colours? I would make a backlight of the L_C_D_ screen with different colours. but not the case. the case would only be in that aluminium titanium stuff, Because apparently from your survey people like colours, let's remember there's a Nokia phone which changeable panels. so that would be the option But it would be expensive, no? If you use colour L_C_D_. instead of that maybe we can change the colour of the assembler. if users want more colours they can pay more money to get this the shapes and they can have different assembly. you you propose something with option i that increase the price if we if you want o more colours on L_C_D_, there's one more decisi one more solution in fact, 'cause there are some some paints that can change colour according to where they are, like they can reflect different colours depending on what is around, like what colour is around, and depending on the temperature, but that's maybe mo too much expensive, yeah. Because I think there are two kinds of people. Those for which the remote control is is to be something useful and those for which is something that that that is specific to them I think I think they would be ready p ready to pay more for that. It might be optional, yeah. Could we integrate something into our remote control, something like light? That they can use it in darkness, like. Hand light, And the remote control's going to be smart but how smart should it be to not to complicate things too much? I heard that it seems that speech recognition is something that can be done Are are you saying here that the remote controls should be aware of who is using it? I just want to say it should be real smart. since we have we want to do some speaker dependent speech recognition so we can use So it could be smart in that way. it might also record the kind of channels you are u more often using
we want the speech recogniser
the concept of the interface. Generally I developed quite a broad concept not only for the interface, but for possible instruction or user's manual and all the complex things that come together with your T_V_ and remote controls. We got our perfect remote control with a lot of buttons and we got explanation for every button and you can use your time and it will take i some days to learn all this buttons and the L_C_D_ is going to be somewhere here and go back button, I don't know really where it is, maybe one of this buttons, maybe this button is power on and off? that's our concept. It's called the millennium remote control. doesn't make sense. This is very ugly. too much concept. we will not use this. We will not use this. But instead of this I will devise That's our concept. And it's got just few buttons, quite low looking, and all this stuff we already we already discussed.
we're to mainly design f mainly need to know which components we'll use for energy, and the material and interface. For energy there are maybe two or three possibilities. First one, we can use simple battery, or we can use traditional solar cells and the material we can have plastic, rubber which is good for this R_S_A_ and then titanium, which can be which have very good look an and then interface we're to use push buttons or liquid crystal d L_C_D_ display. we would like to have some speech recognition s chip in our remote control. this can be simple kind of programmable chip which can use microphone sensors. Still we are looking for possible technical specifications and how w easy we can do and within our pri range, like we're to in our twelve Euros or around that. So we are looking for simple devices or simple technology to do the location of remote control in a room or in a house. we would like to propose battery instead of solar cells and it would be problematic to have enough energy with the solar cells And also we want to go for titanium design instead of rubber or the problem is with this design we found that we can't use double-curved shapes. What is a double-curved shape? Like you can have two curves. we want to go for simple push buttons because it need a simple chip and it's really lesser re really less expensive compared to L_C_D_ which needs advanced chip technology and it's more expensive, since we want to put some other features such as speech recognition we want to reduce cost. I want to know why it b just sorry but for the point before why not the rubber, if it is something that it seems to be light. And also like in if you put a it's be difficult to do all the moulding of buttons and these things W we can use something like you know the whole body's titanium but there are some rubber or I dunno some rubber parts But full assembly
and we want some themes like fruits or vegetables,
now we are on the conceptual design meeting. I will again do the secretary part we will have three presentation first the industrial design, first Rama then Mark and then Sammy. we have to take a decision on the control remote control concepts and we have forty minutes. the decision we want to take on this meeting are on the first on the component concept, so what kind of energy we use what kind of chip on print and one ki kind of case. And also on user interface concept what kind of interface we use and if there is some supplements. And at the end Sammy will give a trend watching on what he's he's been doing.
and we want some kind of buttons
and Sammy the product evaluation.
which i which are for Rama wil design, Mark the user interface design,
we will have next meeting in thirty minutes again. now you have to go straight on this individual action which i which are for Rama wil design, and Sammy the product evaluation. Mark the user interface design, you will work together on a new on on a prototype using modelling clay. and I as always your personal coach will send you specific instruction. we want the speech recogniser and we want some kind of buttons and we want some themes like fruits or vegetables, we want to follow general trend. No, we don't have to, Again, as I said we can also try to make it, to create the trend. are we confident enough on creating trends? we can make it smell like fruit. what about location and these things, people are really interesting on those features? Or they really like They more want these fancy features it has to be fancy Whether it's useful or not doesn't seem to be very important. so I think if nobody else pro provides currently a remote control with that kind of stuff and if we can provide it I think it's a good sell for us Now we have to decide on what kind of fanciness. Do we take titanium smelling like fruit, or do we make spongy fruity-like we will try to explore these two options Maybe you could explore the two option. Could we make a titanium shape? I mean fruit-shaped. at least like we can make banana Doub double-curved. Don't you say that you cannot do double shape curved shape and and s we're to see the whether rubber is expensive In fact I just agreed to make to make the like titanium panels on a whole rubber body. you explore now that you're going to work together these these two. Maybe we can have two different assembly also like one spongy and one kind of titanium. I think we have to choose. If we choose titanium or if we choose spongy still we want to keep L_C_D_? Or I think it's what we say, that we have an an
I'm going to talk about trends and I hope this can help us to to understand l how we should design our remote control. Anyway these days the best source of information is the web as you know, but basically there are in in the market of of remote controls there are three aspects that we should very pay much attention to. The first one, which seems to be the most important one, is that it has to be fancy, it has to have a fancy look and feel. And interestingly this is the very most important thing. It has to be fancy. Strangely enough it's more important to be fancy than to be wi and now that's the second thing it has to be, it has to be technologically i innovative, it has to be new with some of new technology inside and and this is also more important than the last thing which is that it should be easy to use and it should be easy to use as a remote control. And finally of course it has to be useful as a remote control but it seems that it's not so important that it's useful as a remote control. currently the the trends that we see in l in l big cities like Paris and Milan, well, it seems that this year things should have a fruit and vegetable way of of look or feel And I think of course i it applies to everything. It it can travel f from clothe to furniture same idea. And if we co we compare to last year, now it has to be spongy, When we were talking about rubber, I think the rubber aspect might be important because it's what is probably more feasible in terms of sponginess. So maybe titanium it's not a good idea. Think more of something in the colours of like fruit and vegetables and spongy, even in the shape it has to be more round and more look natural somehow. I mean And not those futuristic remote control with angles and and titanium like. these
you will work together on a new on on a prototype using modelling clay.
Okay. So first, let's see the prototype.
So, but if we select the hand dynamo it's okay,
So we are at seventeen dot eight.
Project evaluation, good.. See how Are we a good team?. Is there enough room for creativity? Yeah, yeah. Team-work, very strong, I would say.
let's see if th it's meet the evaluation criterium. so what I propose is that we are going to to have this scale from one to seven. One meaning that, ye yes it fulfils the the criterion, whatever it is. what do you think, is it fancy? So here, two. Up. Then we have technology. d I think it's a one for that, at least. Robustness, uh-huh. It's robust, yeah. Well, so the question is does it have the minimum requirement of re remote control? Okay, two. So size and weight. Up to three for that, Colour and shape. I suggested three. And the last one is adaptive. Okay. Let's go for one. Now we have to do the average. Two point one seven. So now, it has to fulfil the financial criterium? So we are at seventeen dot eight.
So think of what we can cut here. Are we supposed to cut things out now?
Material, we want to stick to titanium. wh what are the strawberries for? The case is silver titanium, no? So, maybe think we can have rubber or some sponges, stuff for strawberries and different colours. Titanium.
wh what are the strawberries for? That's location sensors. And what about the strawberries on the top?
I'm not convince. Well y you know, it's this fruit and vegetable year.
And we have speech recognition. And we want to do the location basically using speech recogniser. And then we have the t sample speaker sensor for speech recognition.
And so, we have buttons and using L_C_D_, or like you can use this jog wheel and select which ever option on the L_C_D_, and then do on and off. So, you you can press these buttons to increase or decrease the volume. And you can choose colours on your day for each day, or even many colours. For the L_C_D_. It's a jog dial for controlling the cursor on the L_C_D_ screen. The scroll-wheel, okay. One L_C_D_ displayed.
Apparently, we have to choose one or the other. if I look at what is the most expensive things, it's the L_C_D_ and the speaker. So, put minus one there, please. I'm not sure if this is legal. Okay, we're on target.
So, we are asked to to make a new remote control for television. And the characteristics of this new remote control should be original and trendy and of course user user friendly. So people can can use it without any any problem.
I'm doing the interface. I'm doing the interface. It was a little confusion about my Okay, I'll for industrial design. And and you Norman?, I'm into marketing. working on i. User interface. A design is basically for industrial design and the user interface. See there's a role for everybody.
Well, I think we should set the the points to to drive the project and B did you send us an email about this? Do you want do you want me to send you a mail? Or you can put it in the shared folder. You get email,. Yeah, from the account manager. I think it's for your guys to how to design it all the aspects so you need that information. Yeah, so each of us has a role to do. We already have our role. So there are three kinds of designs, that's all. We have functional design, conceptual design, and detail design. I think our responsibilities will be assigned when we in our mail we received from the account manager. So, who will be the the responsible for the functional design?
. We maybe you can have a speech recognition interface. You just tell the television I want which channel. Or or you can say for example, I want to list all the programme tonight. Just say maybe I just want to press I wanna have a button for all the movies tonight. So instead of pressing the channel number, I am choosing the programmes directly. I I think if we include a lot of technology on the remote control it will be very costly. Like s you you you say we can use speech. The the idea of using speech to reduce the button, but and it's more natural. Yeah. I mean the main function of remote control is to have something in the hand and we should be very careful about the size of the remote control. If we are going to add a speech interface, I'm not sure with trendy slim size of the remote control it would be able to put a speech recog if you want to put a speech recognition system f interface for that I think the T_V_ itself could have it. And I could talk to the T_V_ television itself. But th the main idea I wanted to s I wanted to say is that there should be a function, instead of choosing the ch T_V_ channel, there's a option you can choose, either T_V_ channels or or pr or the or the contain or the contents of the programme. Yeah, yeah it's it's a good idea it's a good idea but I I think that technically it would be a little bit more tricky to to achieve this than just to because you see now all the T_V_ programmes are available on the webs. We just want to retrieve the content so we can just use the service available. And then there's there are only six buttons for six categories, or sev seven. The most there are only seven buttons. So I just choose the category one and you reuse the same button, for example to to choose among the the sorted list
Well, I think we can have a little discussion about what has to be done and what are your ideas about the About the design or Well, w we want to have a new re remote control for for T_V_ distribution I guess. I mean working remotes we already have. This will be something different from the other remotes remote controls. What we we have to keep in mind the these characteristics. And of course it should not be very costly. Well I I think that Norman and I would think about the technical points and we should discuss it in the next meeting, or What is the most important function aspect? Yeah, it should be easy to work with.
. We maybe you can have a speech recognition interface. I I think if we include a lot of technology on the remote control it will be very costly. Like s you you you say we can use speech. The the idea of using speech to reduce the button, but and it's more natural. Yeah. If we are going to add a speech interface, I'm not sure with trendy slim size of the remote control it would be able to put a speech recog And I could talk to the T_V_ television itself. if you want to put a speech recognition system f interface for that I think the T_V_ itself could have it.
We will get information and then we'll come back in. I think that's the the things to do and to reflect about it and discuss it in the next meeting.
and to reflect about it and discuss it in the next meeting. we will get some information in the next meeting, We will get information So maybe we'll meet in maybe five minutes? And we'll discuss the other other aspects. I think that's the the things to do
B did you send us an email about this? Do you want do you want me to send you a mail? Or you can put it in the shared folder. You get email,. Yeah, from the account manager. I think our responsibilities will be assigned when we in our mail we received from the account manager. So, who will be the the responsible for the functional design? I'm doing the interface. I'm doing the interface. It was a little confusion about my Okay, I'll for industrial design. And and you Norman? See there's a role for everybody.
But th the main idea I wanted to s I wanted to say is that there should be a function, instead of choosing the ch T_V_ channel, there's a option you can choose, either T_V_ channels or or pr or the or the contain or the contents of the programme. Yeah, yeah it's it's a good idea it's a good idea, first one is to buttons i or it could be anything with buttons. to choose content s or channels.
and we need to have the T_V_ connected to internet so we end in order to access the T_V_ programmes by X_M_L_ So we should have specific T_V_? Well, so maybe we we can j we can already think about a way to to access the internet via the television. So it's a good idea if i i if we i if if we think about how to to to build up our remote control w with this functionality in a w which will c which will come in a few years. So you have to anticipate the the future? well, not not to implement it,
Well I I think it will be a, yes, a bit complicated to make a speech recognisers runs on the small ts But I think if you to recognise numbers it's a well-studied problem. I if you just recognise numbers is a limited you have limited vocabulary Oh we can put an limited vocabulary as in the mobile phones. And this can allow to choose the the program, for instance without adding buttons It's going to be very slim. it's not going to take much space also. Yeah, s s speech is a important extra feature I think I mean, for a lazy guys they could say nine and the nine channel comes. but only for the numbers on the channel, or volume up, volume down, brightness, contrast. And the fourth one was the teletext in various languages. Little bit more if it's with extra features. Maybe not less, but they may be willing to pay little bit more for comfort, I no I I think that i if we go for quality people may tolerate for high quality and of course comes with reasonable cost. The features and the cost. I mean we have to look for a trade-off. And of course most of the people are interested in if it's less expensive, It has to be of course a very slim and small one. And next one was the size of the remote control. and yeah adding of a speech interface is always good for a T_V_ remote we we just have to find a mean how to to add a m a a a microphone or well yes a microphone into the the remote control, so What about lighting adaptive options? Yeah as discussed in the earlier meeting, but I think not much people are really interested in this point if it's not really required. According to the re to the new requirements I think we don't need that. but it's quite possible but maybe not in this project. So any things to to discuss? I think as I discussed th that four points would be good for
assume that if you want to go to if you are watching channel two and if you want to go to channel ninety nine, then. Well, then y you you go to the main menu and you have go to channel No, because you choose by channel, but I I think i i if you if you want to to make well a a big jump but well you you have to to have a a a device when you could you could but something that that says more clearly that right, left, up, down, well, the to have the ability to to to write something to the navigator, maybe directly, or
Okay, after having the inputs from industrial design and user interface, I think most of the points which I want to are already covered here. And to find the most interesting features what the users would be interested, then what we have done is we have put a feedback forms in all the magazines, and the users send the feedbacks, and based on that These are the findings which we got and yeah adding of a speech interface is always good for a T_V_ remote And next one was the size of the remote control. It has to be of course a very slim and small one. And of course most of the people are interested in if it's less expensive, I mean we have to look for a trade-off. The features and the cost. I no I I think that i if we go for quality people may tolerate for high quality and of course comes with reasonable cost. Maybe not less, but they may be willing to pay little bit more for comfort, Little bit more if it's with extra features. Yeah, s s speech is a important extra feature I think but only for the numbers on the channel, or volume up, volume down, brightness, contrast. I mean, for a lazy guys they could say nine and the nine channel comes. And the fourth one was the teletext in various languages. It's going to be very slim. it's not going to take much space also. And this can allow to choose the the program, for instance without adding buttons Oh we can put an limited vocabulary as in the mobile phones. I if you just recognise numbers is a limited you have limited vocabulary But I think if you to recognise numbers it's a well-studied problem. Well I I think it will be a, yes, a bit complicated to make a speech recognisers runs on the small ts we we just have to find a mean how to to add a m a a a microphone or well yes a microphone into the the remote control, so What
and I think we don't need lighting adaptive, Yeah as discussed in the earlier meeting, but I think not much people are really interested in this point if it's not really required. According to the re to the new requirements I think we don't need that.
So I come up with a simple design, just keep the v navigation buttons. Yes, that's a good idea, I think. We d we don't we we don't need really much buttons to i if we have a screen to navigate on on the T_V_ so Well, f four five buttons, it's sufficient. It's easy to build, it does not consume much power. Oh, but you have a catch there, assume that if you want to go to if you are watching channel two and if you want to go to channel ninety nine, then. Well, then y you you go to the main menu and you have go to channel No, because you choose by channel, so you don't have hundred channels to choose from. but I I think i i if you if you want to to make well a a big jump but well you you have to to have a a a device when you could you could but something that that says more clearly that right, left, up, down, well, the to have the ability to to to write something to the navigator, maybe directly, or we can think of buttons like in the telephone to send messages or things like that. it's gonna be small. So it'll beep if you wanna find it too small that it goes under the sofa and we can't find it. you just shout y h just it just has to re respond to you when you look for the device. just give it a name and we call him. And responds to you, and
. You can put it on the charger when you when you don't need to use it. It's a good idea. We just make a small charger
So I propose the easy to use prototype. You can navigate on T_V_ screen and we need to have the T_V_ connected to internet so we end in order to access the T_V_ programmes by X_M_L_ and we need some to do some preprocessing. From the technical aspect, the processing should be done on the T_V_ set than on the on the remote controller, right? And then we the speech recognition as Harry says we may just put in we may K_I_V_. What do you mean by the pa pa processing will be done on the T_V_ Yeah, all the processing is done the T_V_ is a compu has some processing power the So we should have specific T_V_? We have to sell a T_V_ with the remote control too. Yeah because are you just wondering what controller okay. I think there there is there is al there there is a a technology like show view who is already available on most of the T_V_ set on recorders or thing like that and we can try t to get this information on to the remote control to to do the processing on the remote control because
But then loo but then I found if you look at you see on the left one there are too many buttons And they are small. O on the right I tried to play with the problem is that if I have hundred channels I have I have to choo press the other button to choose the hundred channels and I have to compose the number so it's very lousy. So you so you move to the next the next one. And then I I look at the user manual they are a hundred pages thick, so we don't want that.
Yeah, but well what about the the new project's requirement? I I I think we should give up with teletext, no? Well, so maybe we we can j we can already think about a way to to access the internet via the television. Yeah, but we can think that in a few years there will be T_V_ set that can access the internet. So it's a good idea if i i if we i if if we think about how to to to build up our remote control w with this functionality in a w which will c which will come in a few years. So you have to anticipate the the future? well, not not to implement it, but to well, to find a way to to add to add this functionality in a yeah, in an in an easy manner, if is possible. Yeah. Because all the T_V_ sets will be digital, right.
So I'm working on the technical functions design. So the the purpose is to to find the important questions to ask is what effect should the apparatus have. So so I found on a webs on the internet and and I found that the function of remote control is to send messages to television set. For example switch on, switch off, switch the next channel and so on and so on. So I found two very good prototypes for for this interface from our competitors This are usual functionality. Ours is a bit different. So these are two example. One is from the other one is from, yeah, engineering centr yeah. This is the most competing prototypes I've found.
I think we should use a F_P_G_A_ for for the functionalities which is easy to to t What is F_P_G_A_? It's a field programmable gateway arrays. So why's it how is it different from the Bluetooth? Well, a F_P_G_A_ is just a chip you can you can pr programme it wi with wh whatever you want. And well the Bluetooth chip is just responsible to make the communication between the two devices. So this are the they have to work together? Or? Do they have to work together or two separate choice Well, th the F_P_G_A_ will produce the the data to send. Or it's something like isn't hardware the first one? And the second one is for the software. Okay, and how about the battery power? you mean that battery would be somewhere there and the remote contro the power to the battery comes through infrared? I think we have to to have embedded b batteries in in the And I I don't think it will need very much power to make it run, so. You can put it on the charger when you when you don't need to use it. It's a good idea. Having a charger rather than putting the battery cells always. People don't like it to have to buy the batteries when they run out. We just make a small charger Because you are using because you are using Bluetooth, if some people have P_D_A_ they can use their P_D_A_ to control the T_V_ if they want to, right? we do not want to make it P_D_A_. Also, but but I I I think the the goal is to sell our remote control.
Right, so I will talk about the the w working design and And well I I will present my my first idea on how to build the our new remote control for television. So I think the first things to do is to define the hardware components neededs to achieve what we want to do. I think I I'll do a survey about what is what is available on the market and what what is the the cheapest possible things we hav we can use. Then I will try with the technical team to to build a prototype And how an and we can start troubleshooting first com communication problems or things like that. And when we are ready with this first prototype I I think we can add some software functionalities on a programmable chip like browsing by content or things like that. So, wha what I think for now is we don't want to have a remote control w which is wired so I think we u we can use a battery for the. Then two programmable chips for both software functionalities and communication. And the communication with the T_V_ set is made through infrared communication So this is the the schema of the o of the future remote controls so you can you can see the components, battery and the two chips goes to the infrared connection to the T_V_ set. The one on top is for the well the functionali the functionalities One is a communication. and the the th red sorry the green one is is to well, putting things together, f transform the data into qu into the format to to to communicate with the T_V_ set.
for the aim of this meeting now is to to make presentation about the work for each one. And take the the decision about the the design and the functionality of the the remote control. And we have think I got a new project requirement. So I think teletext becomes outdated. and I think we don't need lighting adaptive, So the popularity of the since the popularity of the internet, so the remote control should be only used for the the television. And of course we should have our image in the in the design. So, let's start with the the industrial designer.
But I d I don't know it's if it is feasible because I don't know if yet if if the user will move enough to provide the remote all the necessary energy. We we might check with our R_ and D_ department to see if they have this product ready for market. we can see in our R_ and D_ if the kinetic metal is sufficient to provide enough energy.
So what I have f found is that I think basic battery or kinetic energy collection is the is the better way to provide energy because I think solar energy wi won't work in a cluttered environment. For the case well I think that titanium is is a good choice because it's trendy For the interface I think that we can ach achieve all the desired functionalities by s just using rubber buttons, simple buttons
So the here are some examples. So they cluster the buttons together. They group them into col they colour them and they have different forms as well. but this interface are kind of confusing. basically there are too many buttons. So some people are propose voice recognition by the way I receive an email from the from one our departments saying that the voice recognition has been used in the coffee machine for this by a company when you tell the you say good morning coffee machine and the machine are reply to you. And it seems like this voice recognition technology is ready to be used so we might consider that, supposedly. so somebody some people use some people use a spinning wheel th with the L_C_ display so instead of using the buttons you have a L_C_D_ screen and then there you can u you can use that as buttons, Touch screen, I mean. And some people propose a scroll button. Integrated with push buttons or you may have scroll button instead of p just the push button. so there are a few aspects that I collected here. So s basically this deals with special users, children, handicapped people, old people, basically they are programmable, And then they also secure covers, to protect secure and hidden programming and battery covers that will protect your settings. But we don't have to integrate all these complicated features. I'm just saying that the currently in the market there are there are control there are remote controllers f customisable for different people. And you see this is the one where you have the protection cover. maybe useful for children, And for adults wh where you have more control you can see the one inside. So the adults might wanna have a key to lock that to pr so children will not touch the button inside. this is another company that provides big buttons. I see that that is useful for old people But for our product we don't need a big one because you have voice recognition e eventually with use. We should
So the user interface is i it uses the aspect of a computer system, a programme which can be seen or heard or otherwise perceived by the human user and the commands and mechanism the user uses to control its operation and input data. we emphasise more on the graphical user interface here. The idea is to represent buttons as figures, diagrams, symbols and on so you you can easily when you look at the symbols you understand what it is doing. A graphical user interface emphasise the use of pictures.
Okay so I think I will do my presentation on the components concept the first thing I have done is to to made a review together with the manufactural department and have which components was available to build a remote control. So for energy sources we have we have to choose between the solar energy, hand dynamo and kinetic well kinetic technique to to store the energy. We also we also can put a regular battery in the in the remote control. we didn't decide yet which kind of battery we will put inside the the remote. So it's a point to discuss. Concerning the interface we can we can put just simple buttons or scrolls or buttons much more complicated, but it also requires that the chip to process the button is more complicated so. And this is the last point, the choice of chips. What is this single curved Well i i it's it's the the shape of the of the remote. You you will have the well the the curve will fit into your hand when you grab the It's more confog f comfortable that if these it's completely flat. And the battery, is it kind of a rechargeable or it doesn't matter? Yeah the that's the point. The kinetic one is y you can recharge by the and by well by just by moving the ar your arm the well the remote will accumulate energy.
so the thing is you can find out how much an L_C_D_ will cost And also the cost for the speech recognition. Ask our R_ and D_ department. And also the scroller button, how much will it cost. So for my part I will check the prices the the prices difference of what to use, where to use, and s and so on.
But I d I don't know it's if it is feasible because I don't know if yet if if the user will move enough to provide the remote all the necessary energy. We we might check with our R_ and D_ department to see if they have this product ready for market. we can see in our R_ and D_ if the kinetic metal is sufficient to provide enough energy. Check with the v R_ and D_ department the capability of recogniser. It will be difficult to say just the name of the channel.
Well w well I I I don't really see the advantage of having L_C_D_ on the on the remote control if we have a a a big screen and display on the screen. You can use this screen instead of the big se screen, well I think we we can focus on the on the fancy look but well I think L_C_D_ will will make us spend a lot of money for not so big results. so the thing is you can find out how much an L_C_D_ will cost and this menu when you press the menu, in the L_C_D_ displays as you go on pressing the menu it faster displays volume, then the program, then the brightness, contrast and all the stuff. And I think it's increases the cost of the the remote control if you use L_C_D_. I and so it's for the user interface design and industrial design to just think So for my part I will check the prices the the prices difference of what to use, where to use, and s and so on. Yeah I think it should be clearer for us in the next meeting that th these could be included.
So we just made an marketing survey of what people need from our remotes and how it could be special from the other remotes. And we got the best on the responses from the questionnaires. So seventy percent of the users, they find their remote controls very ugly, they don't find it pleasant to use in the size or usage or anything. And eighty percent of the people they are always l I mean they are willing to spend more money if the remote control would look fancy. And the current remote controls do not match well the operating behaviour of the user. And seventy five percent of the users said they zap a lot. And fifty percent say they use only ten percent of the buttons, so the rest of the ninety percent of the buttons they're not used most of the times. And also they cited frustrations with the present remote controls. fifty percent of the time the remote controls are lost somewhere in the room And if the remote control is too complicated it takes much time to learn the functionality of it. fifty percent people they responded that they always lose their remotes and thirty four percent they say that it's quite difficult to learn if it's too complex. So keeping in view all these findings and the frustrations I think this should be the solution for them.
And also the scroller button, how much will it cost.
We we might check with our R_ and D_ department to see if they have this product ready for market. we can see in our R_ and D_ if the kinetic metal is sufficient to provide enough energy.
Or maybe we can include the user manual in the in the remote control and we should have just a button like help and you say and you ik you press the button help Yeah. That's a good idea. So you are display on the screen. On the T_V_ screen the how to use your remote. So that eliminates all the complicated documentation, But people are often enough looking at the help, once they see the help button they say oh this is a complicated stuff. In the case where they need help, in the case where they need help. And let us see what the market demands.
once they see the help button they say oh this is a complicated stuff.
So keeping in view all these findings and the frustrations I think this should be the solution for them. We should have an L_C_D_ on the rem remote control. Well w well I I I don't really see the advantage of having L_C_D_ on the on the remote control if we have a a a big screen and display on the screen. yeah of course it's fancy trendy and so on I mean as our survey says that people are willing to pay more if their remotes are fancy. So if we have a L_C_D_ on the remote, rather than looking onto the T_V_ you just look into a remote and navigate it. It's the same menu as we have saw that iPod remote control. Yeah but when you play with the iPod you don't have a big screen in front of you, s You can use this screen instead of the big se screen, If you re-use the existing screen, we element eliminate the L_C_D_, and if you have the colourful screen you can make the display colourful, fancy, well I think we we can focus on the on the fancy look on the speech recognition if the technology is available but well I think L_C_D_ will will make us spend a lot of money for not so big results. so the thing is you can find out how much an L_C_D_ will cost I mean that should be found out by the Industrial Designers.
And eighty percent of the people they are always l I mean they are willing to spend more money if the remote control would look fancy.
And also the cost for the speech recognition. Ask our R_ and D_ department. Check with the v R_ and D_ department the capability of recogniser.
And it's always good to have an voice recognition for the remote controls. And also the cost for the speech recognition. Ask our R_ and D_ department. Yeah it's o only for a limited vocabulary, say eighty commands or so. And also the scroller button, how much will it cost. Well compared to the to s the simpl simpler simplest button. from the survey we never see that people would like to have some scrolling button. Because they they just they're just frightened to use the scrollings or help button. Yeah I I I think that well as we have seen in the in the presentation well about fifty percent of the of the percent n choose the button so I think to have five simple button is sufficient for our functionality.
Well we can think about having on the on the on the user interface when you switch on the T_V_ you can well write a code or choose a category, if it is kids, things like that. and so it's for the user interface design and industrial design to just think So for my part I will check the prices the the prices difference of what to use, where to use, and s and so on. Yeah I think it should be clearer for us in the next meeting that th these could be included.
And when we're using that t remote and if we misplace somewhere, in the charger we have a small button, and just by pressing the button in the charger the remote control beeps, wherever it is. because every time you're off the computer the T_V_ you are asked the the command the T_V_ com remote controller would tell you to put it back to where to the charger. Or maybe you have to to show some specific programmes for kids and so it's for the user interface design and industrial design to just think So for my part I will check the prices the the prices difference of what to use, where to use, and s and so on. Yeah I think it should be clearer for us in the next meeting that th these could be included.
I think we need to define also a s the set of vocabularies for the speech recogniser because if you want say we can sort by channels or sort by T_V_ programs, you have to decide a category of vocabularies for them. and you can say to your remote control like sports and then on the T_V_ you have a list with with well with sports program playing now we have a problem there. You see if you have a voice commands and you are s you are watching a score on basketball score or something, and if the score comes twenty four thirty five, you've just say twenty five and suddenly the screen the channel goes to twenty five. Well but well e every possible word has a probability to come about of the T_V_ so. So I think there should be a prefix to some numbers Ordinary twenty five you almost there's a probability of being said around sixty seventy percent and T_V_ twenty five I dunno it will be round about one or two percent. But I I I think that the user would like wou would like to associate the channel or call the channel rather than than the numbers. That will be too big. And it will be difficult for the vocabulary also. Check with the v R_ and D_ department the capability of recogniser. It will be difficult to say just the name of the channel. but you have to to have all the name of the channel in your vocabulary. Als might be you just forgot the channel name, you kno only know the number. Or maybe the user can create his own vocabulary, I think there's another way you can do is that you can if when the user ch press a button to choose the channel for example, then what you can do is that the you can make the T_V_ screen to split them into small little little squares of images where you you you have a snapshot of every channel, you just use the control button, you just you you
And the third problem was to find the remote control. Well so we we can think about a well a a vocal command like find You will listen to a peep, special peep. that's exactly what I mean by voice commander. it's always boring to change the batteries of the remotes control, and whenever we don't use the remote control we put it in the charger. so we have some one charger there And when we're using that t remote and if we misplace somewhere, in the charger we have a small button, and just by pressing the button in the charger the remote control beeps, wherever it is. And that's a good idea, I mean it doe it also doesn't require a voice command, because there are problems with a voice command. I mean charger would be fixed because it's always with electricity plugged. what we can do is we can program a function whereby when you press the switch off T_V_ button, the off button, the remote there be s instruction on the screen, please charge charge me. You never get it lost because every time you're off the computer the T_V_ you are asked the the command the T_V_ com remote controller would tell you to put it back to where to the charger. But you can have an button for child lock. I mean I mean I mean you see if it's like that even a kid who wants to have a control he could just plug it and use it, you can't avoid him. So just by pressing the button with some code, you t you put a lock onto the remote, so that he can't use even Well we can think about having on the on the on the user interface when you switch on the T_V_ you can well write a code or choose a category, if it is kids, things like that. Or maybe you have to to show some specific programmes for kids I think these other four points they're the market demands and so it's for the user interface design and
and we asked you to prepare a prototype for the for the remote control. So let's see the what did you prepare. So in last meeting we have discussed the conceptual design S so so I discussed with Guillaume. and we we are both agreed on some two versions of the prototypes, One with and one without L_C_D_s. but both comes with a charger and then detachable and or control module. And detachable big buttons for all people. S okay so I'll show you the the two prototypes. Here we have the first one with the beautiful L_C_D_ display. How much does it cost this one? Well this this prototype is made for about well fi fi fifteen fifteen dollars it's above it's above the budget. but it's just a prototype the and the the production costs we we can achieve about ten dollars.
because we were no not decided whether we wanted to have an L_C_D_ or not because it's too expensive. And you can just browse into the the navigation menu by joystick joystick-like button. You can choose the direction You have on the on the side here the microphone for the for the speech recognition system here. And here the the switch that control if you want The the microphone picks up the speeches from anywhere. Is it an only a single mic or a microphone array? Well so it's a microphone array. Oh it's very costly, microphone array. it's just a single microphone, I I think we we put it here because I think when you when you are browsing your L_C_D_ you will be close to well it's better to to to place it here th than here, for instance. And here is a little switch that control if you want the the speaker recognition system to to be on or off. And so this remote control comes up with its charger. How many b battery is there? Is it n the two A_A_s batteries in it. A_A_ rechargeable batteries. Is that two or one? Actually it's a flexible thing. So and if you want to charge the battery you just put the remote control like that to plug in the the charger and leave it alone, it's alright. I forgot to tell you there is only a single button there, This button is like the mouse is like a joystick, you can move in three hundred and sixty degrees of direction and it the additi functions associated to all the actions you ma you have a click you have a double click all in a single button. You can move up, down, left, right, or you can do a swing. Here I present another version without the L_C_D_. So we have the the second version also with the different button configuration. The second version is also simpler, we d we had just I have to put the microphone also. Uh-huh and also the switch. Basically it's the same things
We can produce such remote control for about four dollars. What's the price to p to produce? Well so the price to produce For the simplest one, say we start from four dollars to produce such a device. The without without the charger it's about well two dollars to produce the microphone and speech recognition systems. Two dollars for the for the add-on modules, and finally three dollars for the charger. So if you sum up everything wi with the L_C_D_, which costs two dollar, you have two plus four plus four plus two plus two. We don't have all the options. so the total cost if you if you want all the fuct functionalities will be about fifteen dollars. it's below the the the budget.
can they be made into a fruit and vegetable types? And what's the idea about the shape of the remote controls? but we are also the well the components will have to change because we have to deal with the shape What we can change is to propose the customers with skins. I think you need to look into the material.
I think we will just have a rough look and then we can make our statements, and we can finalise the product based on this discu So the marketing made an evaluation criteria and these were some of the findings, and in the market the people are not really interested with L_C_D_, without L_C_D_, with speech recognition interface, or without speech recognition interface, but most of the people what they are interested is first thing is, they want to have an fancy look and feel, it should be very fancy with colourful and very handy to hold. And the second thing is it should be much more technologically innovative. Of course in that we could put L_C_D_ or recognition to be more technologically innovative. And the third one is easy to use. since we haven't yet a remote who are allowing to to choose interactively with the T_V_ screen with just four buttons. Well I think that the technical in innovation is is in the product itself here you can find these are the latest fashion updates, and so this in Paris and Milan they have detected this trends that the this year it's going to be an year of fruit and vegetable, so people are really interested to see if they have an remote in the shape of the fruit or a vegetable, or whatever they like. So I think it should be much more customised to make a different shapes. And the second thing is, and if the material, they really do not want it to be very hard, as in the case of very pl plastic or titanium, it should be somewhat spongy. you should find a material that is robust at the same time spongy. Yeah so so finally we have these three criterias. One is fancy look, second is innovative, and third is easy to use.
Yeah and also more well more seriously I think it's it's a good idea to have clear clear points whenever we do a meeting prior to the meeting to have well a list with the points who will be discussed or things like that,
the the the thing that makes this the controller cheap is that it is modular If you want less function i i if you want a reasonable price you pay for the functions that you add on to the system, Something like customised. Yeah for example the L_C_D_, you can take it you can put it put it back in, or you can use the other one, or the speech recogniser with the microphone yeah yeah. You want a microphone to put in the speech recogniser you don't wan you pay less for the system you see. It's pretty flexible in the yeah price. We also have this module for old people with big buttons, clearly labelled, and it acts like the previous one, you just plug in and it works. the i the idea the the conceptual idea is that simplicity and powerful. Simplicity meaning that we have few buttons, powerful is that all the controls with the one you saw we saw earlier in the meetings with lots of buttons n that's our an innovation i in this design here. Okay now we come to other important features that I did not tell you. The first one is the speech recogniser, again it's detachable or add-on. And then we also have security feature it's very robust, so you want more function you pay more.
I think it's it's more easy to make f fancy things when it's not complicated we have been focused all all this time on the on the technical aspect, functional aspect, but also the simplicity.
You also have the the the two other modules for the parental control that that you ca you can add up to the to your remote control i i if you if you want to to have more more power on what you do, and which channel you want to choose and so on. H here is just the the the module for the kids and th if the parents want to watch T_V_, up they come up with their modules, and the material, what's the material again? The titanium
so let's go back to our laboratory and To improve on the design.
the teamwork was very very good. And the leadership was excellent. Yeah and also more well more seriously I think it's it's a good idea to have clear clear points whenever we do a meeting prior to the meeting to have well a list with the points who will be discussed or things like that,
there w there was a there was a issue here is that what are what is the display on the L_C_D_? but you have the same programme on the T_V_ screen. We haven't really determined what are actually actually I mean on the L_C_D_, according to what I understand from your model is, you have a joystick here, and you have L_C_D_, you just press your joystick, you get here a programme. on the T_V_ you don't it doesn't display on the T_V_ now. If you have the L_C_D_, Then there is no meaning in having it on the T_V_. But you cannot display all on a L_C_D_. Anyway for for the users who who who opt for L_C_D_ we'll give them the give them the L_C_D_,
S s oh I think it's better to have this without L_C_D_. As our Programme Manager s Pro Project Manager says that without L_C_D_ it is going to reduce the cost also, what about the integration of speech recognition? That's going to be an optional.
so let's go back to our laboratory and To improve on the design. what about the integration of speech recognition? The speech recogniser is a add-on module. That's going to be an optional. S s oh I think it's better to have this without L_C_D_. As our Programme Manager s Pro Project Manager says that without L_C_D_ it is going to reduce the cost also,
So and we have an evaluation criteria for each one of these, say that we have a seven point scale, from one to seven, and for each of the product you could just give me the scale according to this. So now you have with L_C_D_ and without L_C_D_, so on this scale, if it is true, if it is if it has a fancy look you could just tell me one, or if it is false, it doesn't it looks it doesn't look much fancy, then you could just tell me seven. But who will give the scoring we ourself or or a third party? according to you designers, On on this scale the L_C_D_ remote control. How do you look how does it look? D is it very fancy or doesn't look much fancy? I'll I'll say three or four. I think we can improve on the design. Som someone commented this is like a the stone age design. we have been focused all all this time on the on the technical aspect, functional aspect, but also the simplicity. So I take three on with L_C_D_? So without L_C_D_ how would you rate it? four. I think it's it's more easy to make f fancy things when it's not complicated so removing the L_C_D_ gives us a li more liberty to to have a fancy look. And in the sense of innovativeness, with L_C_D_. Well it's it's the same for both so I will give a five, six. from the innovation aspect I feel that what is most innovative of our prototype compared to the existing prototypes that we saw l in the last meeting is that the retrieval of T_V_ programmes by content, and for now and another innovation we have is simplicity and simplicity, few buttons, we've A lot of functionalities. So without L_C_D_? for both it's the the same innovations. So maybe I can put six to seven. actually to make it with L_C_D_ you make more efforts. then when it is without L_C_D_ there is not much innovativeness. So without L_C_D_ you want to put
so let's go back to our laboratory and To improve on the design.
the the the thing that makes this the controller cheap is that it is modular so you want more function you pay more. for example the L_C_D_, you can take it you can put it put it back in, or you can use the other one,
so let's go back to our laboratory and To improve on the design.
You also have the the the two other modules for the parental control H here is just the the the module for the kids and th if the parents want to watch T_V_, up they come up with their modules, We also have this module for old people with big buttons, clearly labelled,
and then y the other p points are robust and misplacement reminder. So when you finish watching your T_V_ and you the you t you turn off the T_V_, and then there's this message coming out that please put that back to the charger,
Is it n the two A_A_s batteries in it. but both comes with a charger A_A_ rechargeable batteries.
Project evaluation project satisfaction, for example. I don't know, we have to ask these question. Room for creativity. This room is a bit small, but but I think it's okay for us to work with. This is fine for making a presentat for project presentations.
And the leadership was excellent. Yeah I think so. the teamwork was very very good. And new ideas found. Come up with new product. Yeah and also more well more seriously I think it's it's a good idea to have clear clear points whenever we do a meeting prior to the meeting to have well a list with the points who will be discussed or things like that, We achieved project goal I think. that is within the budget. yes, more or less. Without without L_C_D_, without speech recognition, it will be simple. Yeah thank you for your work and
I think it will be better if we have all these modules in the same remote control, because maybe parents will lose these but I mean if you have an add-ons, the kids may just hide the parental module Or maybe parents they can for forget where they put it or, The problem is if i we are bla if a customer wants a certain component, and doesn't want the parental control because it's a couple who do not have children when you sell the product in the market you could meet any kind of people, and not all people will need all the functionalities we propose to them. So you mean that even if these modules will be will be functional will be optional. But the the question is n does those modularity increase the production cost or decrease the production cost? I think it inc increase. because it's three different pieces to to to build but it's I think it's cheaper if you if you already built the all the functionalities on the same module, but Well well the other aspect is that if in the when they have the ar existing product you you gonna maintain the the you're gonna keep the same customer, because the same customer will come back to buy other add-ons. i i so if don't don't buy now they can buy i in the future. attracting them to come back in again and again. Yeah well if the buyers can be up the th would be can be upgraded, it would be a good thing right?
And what's the idea about the shape of the remote controls? can they be made into a fruit and vegetable types? but we are also the well the components will have to change because we have to deal with the shape Or it could be like this the P_C_B_ would be the same for all, but only the exterior shape is different o for all. What we can change is to propose the customers with skins. For example the i the mobile phones nowaday, they sell different kinds of skin and then people just feel that oh I have a new skin and looks better. we can have the same global shape and then add on skins and with with this tex spongy texture things like that. I think you need to look into the material.
maybe a a minimalist design, the least possible amount of buttons. But you should make sure that you have every button they need on it. you don't want to bother people with loads of buttons, but on the other hand they need many buttons
but it is impossible to to accommodate accommodate all the buttons on the s on the difference different televisions sets on one remote control. It's impossible. Because for example Sony television has the opportunity to s to make to make it possible for to see on one side of the screen teletext, and on the other side just n regular television. Because you can't use a Panasonic remote control on a on a Philips television. always with r universal remotes you have to choose the code.
And the production cost will be twelve Euro fifty max.
it's time for some discussion. What's your experience with remote control? I always lose them. A lot of buttons which you don't use Not user friendly. Black, all black. maybe we should try to make it fun. You had different remote controls for different devices. perhaps you can integrate them or something. but then again you you still have a lot of buttons, there's a possibility to g to to put those buttons behind some kind of protection but the usual buttons such as zapping as you call it in Dutch. and the volume control are only the only possible buttons to use directly. maybe a a minimalist design, the least possible amount of buttons. But you should make sure that you have every button they need on it. Because things for teletext, I dunno, w you don't want to bother people with loads of buttons, but on the other hand they need many buttons Because I think a market will be all kind of people. Elderly p el elderly, young people, so. I think the aim is better to use the whole world and Britain, yeah. I think when p when the customers will buy this remote control, they already have the remote control which companies with the the standards remote control with which comes with the television. but it is impossible to to accommodate accommodate all the buttons on the s on the difference different televisions sets on one remote control. It's impossible. Because for example Sony television has the opportunity to s to make to make it possible for to see on one side of the screen teletext, and on the other side just n regular television. Because you can't use a Panasonic remote control on a on a Philips television. always with r universal remotes you have to choose the code.
the Marketing Expert will will take a look at the user requirement specification.
the Industrial Designer will take a look at the working design,
The User Interface Designer will work out the technical functions design.
I'd like to welcome you to our first meeting. I'm the Project Manager of this project, This is the agenda for our first meeting. I will hope we will get acquainted to each other. We'll do a little tool training with these two things. We'll take a look at the project plan. there will be time for discussion. as you probably have noticed there are little black fields on the table. you have to put your laptop exactly in that field so the little cameras can see your face. and there are microphones here also. and I'd like to hear who you are and what your functions are on this project. and my function is User Interface Design, I think. I'm the Industrial Designer I'm Marketing Expert. My job is in the company to promote company or promote products to the customers.
I said we're working on a project and the aim for the project is to to create a to design a new remote control which has to be original, trendy and of course, user friendly. It consists of three phases, namely the functional design, conceptual design and detailed design. As you can see, all of these phases consists of two parts, namely individual work part and a meeting But first I will tell you something about the tools we have here. They are smart boards. As you can see, you can give a presentation on them. And this one here is a white board. as you also noticed this presentation document is in our project folder and every document you put in this folder is it is possible to show that here in our meeting room. As you can see, this is the same tool bar as is located here. the most functions we will use will be to to add a new page, to go back and forward between pages, and this is the pen with which you can draw on the board, for instance and then you can write things like test or whatever you want. it's not such a fast board, and of course you can also, when you click here, erase things, And you can also delete an entire page, but we ask you not to do that. because we want to save all the results. And you can also let's see I think it's here change the colour of your pen,
that's what you will need for our first exercise, because I'm going to ask you to draw your favourite animal. to do it on a blank sheet, with different colours and also with different pen widths and a favourite characteristic can be just one word. Or maybe you should guess what I'm drawing,. it could be a turtle, or a snail, It's a giraffe. it can reach everything. And I hope I can also reach a lot with this project. Could you write the words, underneath it? I've drawn a dolphin because of its intelligence. You can try out the eraser now.
from the finance department I have learned that we are aiming for a selling price of twenty five Euros. And we're hoping for a aim of fifty million Euros and we are hoping to achieve that by aiming for an international market. And the production cost will be twelve Euro fifty max.
here we are already at our functional design meeting. I'm project manager but on the meetings I'm also the secretary, which means I will make minutes if I'm right, there are three presentations, And we will also take a look at new project requirements, if you haven't heard about them yet. well I don't know who wants to go first with his presentation. I'll go first. Okay. I'll go first yeah. I wanted to explain the working design of the remote control. when you press a button, that's when you do pr for example when you want to turn up the volume, a little connection is made on a little print plate the the chip makes a Morse code like signal which then is si signalled to several transistors And that makes the the infra-red lights signal which is sent to the television set. the findings that I found searching up some detailed information about the remote controls, are that they are very easy to produce, it's possible to make them in mass production and the technology's already available, I made a little animation of about how a tran our remote controller works. the sub-component, I suppose that you understand what a sub-component is, is f in this example it's the button. when it is pressed down,, the switch is ter is is switched on, so with the wire is sent to the to the chip in co-operation with the battery of course, I wrote down some personal preferences about the remote control. Of course it is very handy if the remote control is hand held, I personally pref prefer that it would be p come available in the various colours, and easy to use buttons. Perhaps soft touch, touch screen buttons because the rubber buttons are always they slightly they can be slightly damaged, so the numbers on the buttons are not possible to read anymore. And well as I said before th we can make several designs.
So we don't have to make it very small, like like a mobile phone or something, so the buttons sh should be that small, or shouldn't be that complex because we have the L_C_D_ screen, we have the various options. So we have to that keep that in mind that if you're going to implement L_C_D_ screen, you don't have to make it that hard to learn or to use. but an L_C_D_ screen, the problem with the L_ sc L_C_D_ screen is that elderly people fr from forty five to for sixty five years don't use the L_C_D_ screen a lot. so those they those have to h be find very easily. but like I said, L_C_D_ screen is easily to use And it should be easy to use. Especially the volume buttons, the channel buttes buttons and the number buttons to zap through the channels.
we're going for an L_C_D_ screen? I think it's the most easier thing, But for now it's L_C_D_. Okay.
I dunno did everyone receive an email with the new project requirements? then I think it's a good thing that I made a separate slide of them teletext does has become outdated since the popularity of the internet. So that's the first thing we I think we should pay less attention to teletext. the remote control should only be used for the television, otherwise the project becomes more complex, our current customers are within the age group of forty plus, and new product should reach a new market with customers that are younger than forty, And a last point, but also very important, our corporate image should stay recognisable in our products, which means that our corporate colour and slogan must be implemented in the new design. according to our agenda it's then time to take a decision on the remote control functions. you said it should only work with one appliance? Yeah. Only be used for television. Then it should have on, off, Standby options, the basics then by a volume, channel, one till two zero numbers on it, A button where you can change from one number to two numbers. because some T_V_s, if you press the t one and then the two, it be between five secs it make twelve, I think it's easy to implement a button with a s s what which especially do that, and that's that's not relaxed But all the television makes use of those button where you first press that button and then press two digits to to get new product should reach a market with customers that are younger than forty, younger people have now, sixteen till to twenty five age, are f eighty one percent interested in L_C_D_ screen. But I think that that collides with our mission to make it very cheap. A touch screen probably even more. perhaps we should we should focus on that L_C_D_ screen. you don't know how much it costs, the L_C_D_ screen. I don't have any costs here, But if you would do an L_C_D_ screen do we have don don't you have
perhaps we should we should focus on that L_C_D_ screen. A mute button. The most important things on a f on an on an remote control are channel selection, volume con selection, and power s power usage. And other other less important things are screen settings, audio settings, and channel settings, I've written down an an on or off button, volume selection, channel selection, the digits from one to zero,. or from zero to nine. a digits button to switch between one and two digits, mute button, a separate menu for teletext, a battery indicator. we could also implement a audio settings, screen settings and channel settings, but as sub-menus. Channel settings.
and I looked at technical functions design of the remote. I did this by looking at examples of other remote controls, of how they they look, and information from the web that I found. well what I found was that th the actual use of the remote control is to send messages to television set, adjust volume, that kind of thing. There are some examples of remote controls. You can see they are very different. The one has got all the functions that you could possibly need and an lot of buttons etcetera. And the other is more user friendly, little with big buttons. I guess you could better y you should look at a a user centred approach, A lot of buttons they may think from I don't need s as much as that. personal preferences is is a simple remote, with the basic functions that you can need that you could use. And then make it I would make so that you can could use it on more than one appliance. If you have one that does with the vi the the video, it could also work with with the stereo, you could reuse the buttons And it should be a user friendly, clear buttons, and not too much.
And a last point, but also very important, our corporate image should stay recognisable in our products, which means that our corporate colour and slogan must be implemented in the new design.
We're going to j discuss the functional requirements of the remote, that means that functions user n want to have on the remote control, The methods I I prefer is we're going to look which section of the users we are going to focus a l on more. Younger people, from sixteen to thir forty five years are more interested in fj features like L_C_D_ screens, speech recognition e etcetera. And we possess about two third of the market from in that range of age. The elderly people, from forty five years to sixty five years are not that much interested in features, and we possess less than two third, that's two fifth, of the market share in that area. Fifty percent of the users lose their remote often. Seventy five percent of the users also find it ugly, and fif seventy five of the users zap a lot, Remote control has to have to have a low power usage, because s w seventy five percent of the users only zap one time an hour, The volume button and the channel buttons are the two most important buttons on the remote control, so those they those have to h be find very easily. Buttons. Like what all colleagues said, have to have to be minimalized. or in L_C_D_ screen. but an L_C_D_ screen, the problem with the L_ sc L_C_D_ screen is that elderly people fr from forty five to for sixty five years don't use the L_C_D_ screen a lot. So we have to that keep that in mind that if you're going to implement L_C_D_ screen, you don't have to make it that hard to learn or to use. because we have the L_C_D_ screen, we have the various options. so the buttons sh should be that small, So we don't have to make it very small, like like a mobile phone or something, The last but not least, younger people are more critical about the features. And the older people spend more money, and easily on a remote control. Because they use the remote control often more often
the remote control should only be used for the television, otherwise the project becomes more complex,
And maybe a low battery indicator? On the screen.
and new product should reach a new market with customers that are younger than forty,
And go to standby mode when you don't use it,
so I think it's better when th the T_V_ shuts down, the remote shuts down.
teletext does has become outdated since the popularity of the internet. So that's the first thing we I think we should pay less attention to teletext.
and we could make an a a separate menu on the L_C_D_ screen for teletext. so not too much teletext support, but in a separate menu,
so make it possible to not display a button at ten points Functional designs for the elderly you could make it possible to enlarge the screen, And the possibility to enlarge buttons or to have large buttons
But would it be useful to imple implement both? Yeah, if the costs al allow it. it should be done. If it could be done, should be done. so we only do this when we have enough money left.
of put it in a recharger. Charger. So we are going for the for the recharger.
but also on the older, and will they use it if it only has an L_C_D_ screen? but market share fro for for forty years and younger is higher than that of sixty five and younger.
But I think that that collides with our mission to make it very cheap. A touch screen probably even more. you don't know how much it costs, the L_C_D_ screen. I don't have any costs here, if it costs gets too much, too expensive, then yeah, we should be sticking to rubber buttons. I think that that they will send you some information about the cost of L_C_D_ screens. if you you receive an email about that, can you post it in the
So we don't have any normal buttons I think it looks a lot more fancy if you use if you don't have any buttons on the s on on remote control. So actually we're going to create a a button-less remote. No buttons at all.
But then you also have to s have somewhere where you can put a remo recharger near your couch because otherwise you have to walk a long way when you twoft want to turn on the T_V_. just a cable, or a even a a a a a charger where you can mount it on. Something like that,
it should be a standard move to to put your remote control in the charger when you're done watching television,
power supply is one of the most important things. Perhaps you should be able to to switch the control off. If you have an L_C_D_ screen that's burns all the time I dunno.
And a teletext, but that is not of the question. But shouldn't you put a button of for teletext on the for the people who want to use it? and we could make an a a separate menu on the L_C_D_ screen for teletext.
Maybe only the on and o on and off button. But isn't idea to use what you said, normal on and off button for the T_V_, But a not as normal button, in the L_C_D_, maybe there should be a separate button apart from the L_C_D_, There has to be a on button on the remote, No you just tap I think. because when you touch the L_C_D_ screen when it is in standby mode, it should pop on. I guess if you use the L_C_D_ screen, you first have to search where is the on button, But if you have a normal on button on the on the remote, then you do the on, I think it looks a lot more fancy if you use if you don't have any buttons on the s on on remote control.
And you said something about speech recognition? also ninety one percent sixteen to twenty five, twenty six to thirty five years, seventy six percent, and thirty six to forty five, thirty five percent. twelve fifty, twelve fifty. I know let's do a speech. But they want to talk into the remo remote control, or something, I think an L_C_D_ screen should be suf sufficient. But when you look at the percentages but nobody knows how much it will cost. I think I think it's better to have L_ L_C_D_ screen, But would it be useful to imple implement both? Yeah, if the costs al allow it. but how would you like to implement that, that you say volume up, and then it goes up, Certain systems already exist, I think. Then you also have to have different languages if we go international. so we only do this when we have enough money left.
I think they don't need that big of C_P_U_. Yeah, it's quite a simple L_C_D_ screen., I don't I dunno I don't think that's you need some kind of C_P_U_, I guess. but it the the remote control has to know whether you're in a settings menu or just you just want to turn up the volume. So it has to have some kind of a calculation unit or C_P_U_ Because we're projecting projecting the buttons on the L_C_D_ screen.
Maybe it's better to to include rechargeable batteries We already decided that on the previous meeting. which you can recharge through the docking station. if the badg the batteries are dead then you can re you can change them. but it should be th I think normal batteries, normal plain batteries you can buy at the supermarket or retail shop. Yeah.
And we won't include a a pen, or something to point, we we want to do it with our fingers, Because if you lose the pen if you lose the pen you can't use Yeah o yeah, if they think it's handy to use a pen.
So we have to decide if we're going to use real hard rubber, or soft rubber. Or something something between that. Soft rubber. like like like a a eraser or something. That's the bit you can press it in, Yeah it's quite hard but you can press it in. but but a hard rubber like this? Or softer rubber hard rubber I think.
Perhaps you could find something in the middle. round corners, but s but square, yeah. But maybe then both groups won't buy it. So it's a bit square, but it's also a bit round. So we should first decide about shape, I think. but I think it should be larger. Looks a bit like a Game Boy now. the shapes is something between the square shapes with round colo corners and a round shapes? I think it's more round than square. But I think it should be a bit longer, perhaps.
the batteries, we also thought about that already, will be chargeable with an option for a mount station normal plain batteries you can buy at the supermarket or retail shop. Yeah. Maybe it's better to to include rechargeable batteries We already decided that on the previous meeting. which you can recharge through the docking station.
So then it's very handy to to scroll down, And I think I would it would make even more fancy because you have another interesting thing on the side you get w when you use the settings menu for example to look up some some channels on your on your television, you should scroll scroll down on a menu which probably does not fit on your screen.
And we won't include a a pen, or something to point,
we wanted to make it from rubber got a single curved rubber
and especially notice that the Industrial Designer and the User Interface Designer are going to work together on a prototype drawing on a smart board,
maybe I should should show some points on which we should take a decision. So we can discuss these points. those points energy question mark. are we going to do it with separate docking station chip on print and case. I think energy were batteries The docking station. Maybe it's better to to include rechargeable batteries We already decided that on the previous meeting. which you can recharge through the docking station. if the badg the batteries are dead then you can re you can change them. but it should be th I think normal batteries, normal plain batteries you can buy at the supermarket or retail shop. Yeah. what was with the chip on print? Chip on print with a with a simple a sim not a simple but a but how did this how does that with a L_C_D_ screen? You still have a print plate. I dunno what w what we have to decide about that. chip on print, I think what they mean with the regular rubber buttons that you got, it's always clear for the remote control when you press a certain button. But when you got a L_C_D_ screen, with no with not the buttons are not always on the same place, but the p print plate of L_ L_C_D_ screen is more advanced than a normal print plate, you need some kind of C_P_U_, I guess., I don't I dunno I don't think that's Yeah, it's quite a simple L_C_D_ screen. I think they don't need that big of C_P_U_. but it the the remote control has to know whether you're in a settings menu or just you just want to turn up the volume. So it has to have some kind of a calculation unit or C_P_U_ Because we're projecting projecting the buttons on the L_C_D_ screen. there are also some some questions about the concepts I think what we should also have on, I just remembered, a menu to go back through the first if if you touch options, you can't go back to this right away now. Isn't it better to
and how about my idea of making it with one single curve? I thought that was a quite good got a single curved rubber
what's the standard colour? we have different colour. You should you should have a black one because I think black is standard. Dark grey, something like this this colour or something. I think it's better to have silver nowadays. Yeah the the silver black are our main colours. Yeah. w what about a yellow thing, it'll be a banana yellow, we have. Green, wood, brown. But if you use silver, rubber s silver rubber isn't fancy. I would think about colours like red, yellow, green, blue, The fruity colours and the autumn colours, like red and brown, dark red and brown. And and do we have to have a normal black one, or
Because we decided to have two kind of remotes, two designs, or was it two colours? We should decide whether it's going to be with round shapes. I think like my colleague, you said, is that's e better, or for the elderly people something like like the iPod or something, with round squares. You could you could change the colours, that was also the idea. I guess changing colours will be easier than changing Changing just the shape of the remote control? Perhaps you could find something in the middle. round corners, but s but square, yeah. But maybe then both groups won't buy it. and the L_C_D_ screen was rather small.. w I think that L_C_D_ screen should be like but I think it should be larger. Yeah, three quarters. Larger I think. Looks a bit like a Game Boy now. So it's a bit square, but it's also a bit round. Look something like that. Autumn colours like red, brown. So maybe we could give it like wooden loo look look or something in that colour. between the young people? Fresh, exciting. And the old people, old and boring. like I said, young people like more soft materials and spongy ones So we have to decide if we're going to use real hard rubber, or soft rubber. Or something something between that. Soft rubber. like like like a a eraser or something. That's the bit you can press it in, Yeah it's quite hard but you can press it in. So we should first decide about shape, I think. but if yo if you make the the L_C_D_ screen as large as the remote control itself, you'll you'll always get some You always touch it, because you have how much? Nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen buttons on the screen. Because some fat people with d thick fingers will press three buttons at same time. And we won't include a a pen, or something to point, we we want to do it with our fingers, Because if you lose the pen if you lose the pen you can't
but the p print plate of L_ L_C_D_ screen is more advanced than a normal print plate, Chip on print with a with a simple a sim not a simple but a
But then you should also find a place You could if you do it like this you could put it in a corner or something. you can make a very sensitive microphone, maybe at the bottom where you can can hel hold it with you hand that there's also a microphone But that's not import I think that's not im very important You could p you could put it in a logo of the company. between the round of the R_. because a microphone is very small thing, but you can make it look like it's big
The most important thing people liked last year was that the remote control should be look look fancy. The second important thing that w should be if inv in innov innovative, like the L_C_D_ screen that's quite innovative And the third thing is it should be easy to use. I think with only one menu, four button, channel, volume, it should also be enough for easy to use. The personal preferences for the young people, they liked fruity colours like banana yellow, strawberry red and stuff. The round shapes, and soft material m materials like the rubber. It should be soft i it should feeling spongy or s Sponge Bob like things. Elderly people like au colours which y are being seen in autumn like woods dark brown, red, deep reds and stuff. They liked square shapes with round edges. And hard materials like wood, titanium. And then I th I I personally thought the front side of the shape should be something for the youngsters like like It's it's a bit like a banana. And for the elderly people just plain old.
The other buttons and on here the top. I think it's it's easier to have it something like Oh a button minus here, plus over here. A minus here, plus over here. If you make the screen vertical it doesn't matter. Isn't it better to have the sound and the general buttons horizontal? I think I would put a plus and a min here. And then the P_ in the mid in the middle But I'm going to look if I've got some examples We'll leave that to the usability engineering then. So not how much n not how often it's used, but W what's what's usual or normal. because I have two televisions at home. One is horizontal, one is vertical, it does it doesn't really matter, I think we have we don't have to decide about that now
I'm going to tell you something about a trend watching. The trends from the past years, what the people like, what the youngsters like, what the elderly people liked about shapes, colours, material and stuff. The most important thing people liked last year was that the remote control should be look look fancy. The second important thing that w should be if inv in innov innovative, like the L_C_D_ screen that's quite innovative And the third thing is it should be easy to use. I think with only one menu, four button, channel, volume, it should also be enough for easy to use.

They liked square shapes with round edges. And hard materials like wood, titanium. And then I th I I personally thought the front side of the shape should be something for the youngsters like like It's it's a bit like a banana. And for the elderly people just plain old. I think like my colleague, you said, is that's e better, or for the elderly people something like like the iPod or something, with round squares.
will be chargeable with an option for a mount station I thought a little bit about the interface. how it should look. And we determined that will not be no buttons, but only an L_C_D_ screen, first there are some new findings and new technology for speech recognition. And this is that you you ask you give a question through through the device and it answers you. And they already put this in an in a coffee maker. This and there's an easy way to program that perhaps it's useful, perhaps for because people lose the remote, they can yell remote where are you and calls or something. And then I have to go out of the presentation because I tried to make some kind of a a idea of how it should look like And perhaps we could implement that. I tried to the L_C_D_ screen I tried to sort of to draw. I thought at least the icon for the volume. and then the buttons above and below the and the and the mute button also recognisable as an icon. I think it's not really on scale and and so forth. an options button. It's options is the settings of the remote and of the T_V_ and that kind of thing. Perhaps we could be more curvy the remote perhaps should, so that it's better in your hand or something. But and and a microph microphone for the speech recognition if we want to implement that. and then if you press the op options button, now we have an example of and then you should get the other options with what what you could do And it's also I thought think we discussed earlier that older people don't really want to use these extra settings. And you could put in a an a really s little scrolling device on the side of your remote, so you could scroll scroll across these things.
welcome everyone to our next meeting. but I've prepared a little presentation once again or at least an agenda I think the biggest part of the presentation will be on your side. we are here at the conceptual design meeting, which is hereby opened. today we once again have three presentations, if I'm right, and after that we will take a decision on the remote control concepts. once again I will try to write some minutes I'd say let's start with the first presentation. in the same order as last time? Components design, first of all I've d subtracted some of the components that is that are used are w w you know from what the remote control's formed. first of all, the case, the case, the surrounding of the of the the remote control. the case was is made from rubber, I suppose. because when you use a remote control a lot of people will will drop their remote control the titanium was also an option. But it's a very expensive material. rubber is, I think, the best suitable material to use for our it's poss it's also possible to create fancy colours with rubber. titanium you have to paint it and with that it's possible to scratch it I h I had an idea single covered curved, sorry, single curved. it's t two dimensional. I think it's it's best to draw I thought of an idea like this. So it also looks nice when it's on your table. it doesn't lay flat down on the table, but it's c it's stands. the graphical user interface and the buttons, we also thought about that already. I thought about the L_C_D_ touch screen, And it should be made of strong plastic and it should be bright. this should be our button component. the batteries, we also thought about that already, And they should be long lasting, not not be empty in about two minutes or thirty minutes or forty minutes of use. there was an option to use s a rather simple chip but I think because of our highly requiring
I think it will, No, I don't think very true because the colours. I think it's a three. because w we designed it for young people especially, Because younger peoples are cr critical and they wanted a lot of features on this thing. n not exactly but if it had some games on it or something like that, I think they like the speech. L_C_D_ screen and scroll. you have all buttons on it which you'd like, microphone extra, L_C_D_ screen extra, scroll thing extra.
then it's possible to make. You lose this one, you got eleven point five Y yea the scroll wheel is dropped.
Big microphone. just just an idea about how to m th that could also be possible. perhaps you should make it a bit big, so people know it's there The microphone could be just a minor hole on the left button.
It has relatively few features, those are features. the L_C_D_ touch screen is feature. The microphone is a feature. No, aren't the features and that you can change the channel's feature,
We could lose the curve. Nah. And I think we should lose the curve. then it will won't stand up from the table. And then you can keep the curve.
because I have to write the final report now.
A battery. One battery,
I think we should scrap the sample speaker. Scrap sample speaker? you should you should drop the speech recognition. But I think the only option is to drop the sample speaker.
I think we also have to go to our own rooms again,
It oh it's in the background. Oh. it would be something like this from the side, but with a bit of curve here, Single nee single curved. And then you can keep the curve.
Eighteen and a half, We have to lower it with six points. We could lose the curve. Nah. We could lose the scroll wheel. You could make it just a regular scroll wheel. if you can't push it you have to tap the the options window button here and then scroll down with the d with with the button. Normal scroll wheel. And I think we should lose the curve. I think we should scrap the sample speaker. then it will won't stand up from the table. Could could we do it on a regular chip on print or something? otherwise we don't have an L_C_D_ screen. Scrap sample speaker? you should you should drop the speech recognition. And then you can keep the curve. Or make it on a hand dynamo, but I don't think that will work. Ma make it with wood instead of rubber? We could make it titanium instead of rubber. What is special colour? Is that the wood wood I think it is. But I think the only option is to drop the sample speaker. Th then we still have too much three. Point three. Let's make it thirteen or fourteen. That's a scroll wheel. Don't make it wood. we can make it brown, dark brown, not wood. a all kind of colours? special colours, fruity colours. but it's a special colour than just rubber colour. You have to add something to the rubber to make it green. then we have to scrap everything we got If we lose the scroll wheel and make it totally depending dependent on the touch screen then it's possible to make. How d how many colours? but we we we are we have yellow, red, black, titanium. But I think when you use the colour that's not originally the rubber then you use special colour, but we're gonna make it yellow red, and then you add you have two special colours on top of the one we have now. I then I think I p I don I don't think they me mean they're special You don't need four of
That's a scroll wheel. If we lose the scroll wheel and make it totally depending dependent on the touch screen then it's possible to make. You lose this one, you got eleven point five
the next part might be a little bit difficult to do in a group, but I am willing to try it. Because we are going to look at the finance and I have a nice Excel sheet to do that. and we're going to calculate the production costs, and if they are under or at twelve Euro fifty, we're good, and if they're not we're going to re-design, but we have to do that very very quick I think, Perhaps we've got features that don't exist in the Excel sheet. The microphone. maybe I could ask one of you to fill it in, so that I can also take minutes, count number of functions, because for every button you have to pay and there are different screen shots, so or different different screens, A battery. One battery, advanced chip, we have sample speaker. we already on nine. Single nee single curved. Rubber. No, we don't have push button. but with special colour we have. A special form, We don't got the button supplements. Eighteen and a half, We have to lower it with six points.
Rubber.
a all kind of colours? special colours, fruity colours. but it's a special colour than just rubber colour. You have to add something to the rubber to make it green. How d how many colours? but we we we are we have yellow, red, black, titanium. But I think when you use the colour that's not originally the rubber then you use special colour, but we're gonna make it yellow red, and then you add you have two special colours on top of the one we have now.
Scrap sample speaker? you should you should drop the speech recognition. But I think the only option is to drop the sample speaker. we we dropped the speech recognition together with the speaker.
Deadlines were sometimes very short. Bu but stressful. You think, no, my presentation isn't ready. so some some things I had in my presentation, they already told, and you had information I also had, you had information I didn't have But the technology was fantastic. Yeah, the technology's okay. I I don't really like the board, but sometimes it doesn't erase perhaps it is easier to get one of those dig digital pens or so and to and lay it next to that keyboard over there. you don't think the SMARTboard is is really useful but it doesn't really work all the time. Because when you put this pen on the screen for exam and line is d being drawn at at two or three centimetres below. so it's maybe a bit unnatural also. The project because of the deadlines you didn't had the time to have, you didn't have time to to make a very qualitati qualitative presentation. So you used this the different PowerPoint presentations and what about this digital pen? I didn't use it at all. it's quite handy I think. it did work pretty well. it is easy for to design something and then load it in your computer. It's b bi little bit too big to write. The information was sometimes a little bit too late it it it took a lot of time before you got your ema You just sit there for ten minutes. At some times I Sometimes I received like like five emails at at one moment, No, I I never got that. I got like one email after ten minutes or something. I think lik oh and information was a bit low I think, sometimes, and I never new we have t we had to yeah made a made a rec a remote control. And I didn't know what to do for the first ten minutes before we got here, but after all we can say we are satisfied, but it it could've been better. we would have gotten more information. more information about the costs. that was a bit mean
advanced chip,
Ma make it with wood instead of rubber? Don't make it wood. we can make it brown, dark brown, not wood. a all kind of colours?
And I think we should then move on to the production evaluation because of the time. and then we are going to the project or product evaluation. what did you think about the process? How satisfied are we? Deadlines were sometimes very short. Bu but stressful. You think, no, my presentation isn't ready. I think we it should be b it would be better if we worked a little bit together. Now we worked through each other, you had information I didn't have and you had information I also had, so some some things I had in my presentation, they already told, I don't think that is the best way to work at for such project. So you would say communicate during our individual work. or maybe session of five minutes together or something, but but why not work here together, for example? Why should we be separated from each other in those difference different rooms? probably to simulate the whole working process, like she told. Then you can work together too by mail or by, I dunno, chat, something, But the technology was fantastic. Yeah, the technology's okay. I I don't really like the board, but sometimes it doesn't erase perhaps it is easier to get one of those dig digital pens or so and to and lay it next to that keyboard over there. you don't think the SMARTboard is is really useful but it doesn't really work all the time. Because when you put this pen on the screen for exam and line is d being drawn at at two or three centimetres below. so it's maybe a bit unnatural also. The project because of the deadlines you didn't had the time to have, you didn't have time to to make a very qualitati qualitative presentation. So you used this the different PowerPoint presentations and what about this digital pen? I didn't use it at all. it's quite handy I think. it did work pretty well. it is easy for to design something and then load it in your computer. It's b bi little bit too big to
welcome everyone. as you may have noticed I created separate folders because it was tending to get a little busy in our shared project documents folder. I don't know if everybody put their own documents in the right folder, save in the folder. Save as project. I'm still going to take some minutes, and if I'm right, you two are going to give a prototype presentation? And m did you do something with evaluation criteria? And then we have to look at something which is less nice, the finance aspect, whether we can afford what we have designed, and if we can we can commence the final part which is the production or project evaluation, This is about the total remote control. We made it green. there's one of the colours we would like to see in our prototype. And the screen light blue. this the scroll button and the microphone on the on the sides here under. And the R_ and R_ logo, Big microphone. just just an idea about how to m th that could also be possible. perhaps you should make it a bit big, so people know it's there The microphone could be just a minor hole on the left button. we also made some ideas about how the options menu would work. You push the scroll button and a drop down menu or a pull out menu comes out and you get you get the options becoming available. For example T_V_ settings, remote settings, et cetera. So you can scroll down too with the scroll button, it's also nice to see that we made a small menu, the options menu becoming available when pressing the scroll button, and the opportunity to use the teletext, and we think that it's very handy to put it not under the options menu, but in Yes. In an apart Perhaps we should use the teletext sign this is the total interface that f of the L_C_D_ screen. the numbers, which is pretty straight forward. but It's the button where you can switch channels. just when you are one and you
it's looks fancy, especially with the green colour. And the the curves which we decided, Only what happened to the single curve we spoke about last meeting? It oh it's in the background. Oh. it would be something like this from the side, but with a bit of curve here, it's also very handy if you make a side curve way to make the the remote control very thin at the bottom at a bottom at a bottom. make it rather thick on the top, because on the top it has the screen, Isn't going to be a little bit heavy at the top? I think yeah, the battery should be in here, fancy enough means, does it comes to the younger people and the elder people. I if you don't make it green, then the elder people won't won't like it. all the colour colours don don doesn't matter that m that much now, I think especially because of the microphone and the L_C_D_ screen also. Alright, it's a one. Oh it's a one. Yeah, I think two. It's very fancy, I think. I think it is, because it has an L_C_D_ screen, a mi microphone. And the scroll is rubber, Also uh-huh the buttons, are they easy to find? Yeah, because they're right on your screen. The options are it little bit harder, It's easier than the regular remote control. I think th I think the options buttons are not the the easiest way to to where you have to find out what which sign or icon means on every button. So you have t you have to use the the the manual to understand most A two, okay, I personally think, because I d I don't think i maybe it's easy to use, I I think if you have the button at the right, I don't think you can find the option button that easy. but you have y then you have here s written option on here, the teletext button, For young people I think it's easy to use. I think it's the most useful remote control
my task was this time to put up a questionnaire by which we can evaluate the design of the remote control by the questions we requirements from the of the users. Questionnaire with seven point scale from one to seven, from true to false, like question, is remote big enough, we can say it's true or it's false by steps. One means absolutely not true, seven means true. is the remote control fancy enough, is it in innovative enough, and is it easy enough to use. Is the design fancy enough? it's looks fancy, especially with the green colour. And the the curves which we decided, Only what happened to the single curve we spoke about last meeting? It oh it's in the background. Oh. it would be something like this from the side, but with a bit of curve here, it's also very handy if you make a side curve way to make the the remote control very thin at the bottom at a bottom at a bottom. make it rather thick on the top, because on the top it has the screen, Isn't going to be a little bit heavy at the top? I think yeah, the battery should be in here, fancy enough means, does it comes to the younger people and the elder people. I if you don't make it green, then the elder people won't won't like it. all the colour colours don don doesn't matter that m that much now, I think especially because of the microphone and the L_C_D_ screen also. Alright, it's a one. Oh it's a one. Yeah, I think two. It's very fancy, I think. I think it is, because it has an L_C_D_ screen, a mi microphone. And the scroll is rubber, Also uh-huh the buttons, are they easy to find? Yeah, because they're right on your screen. The options are it little bit harder, It's easier than the regular remote control. I think th I think the options buttons are not the the easiest way to to where you have to find out what which sign or icon means
Do you know how how I can wake it up? I've lost my screen. Never close your laptop.
Well I was I was thinking since a T_V_ is mostly used together with a V_C_R_ or D_V_D_ player or recorder, and not with a stereo, I think it should be good to include functions for V_C_R_s and D_V_D_ players, recorders. I thought it was only for television. So so we probably don't have to have to have the functions for D_V_D_ player or V_C_R_. Yeah, but most television remote controls support other functions as well.
And our profit aim is fifteen million Euros.
The market range is international, so it's gonna be sold world-wide,
Well, welcome to the kick-off meeting. Well, this is the agenda for today. examples of the tool training, project plan discussion and the closing. Okay, the project aim is to design a new remote control., some of the oje objectives are that is has to be original, trendy, and user-friendly., I oh forget I forget the whole acquaintance part, but we we all know each other. we begin with the functional design, then we go to the conceptual design and the detailed design. Every level of design consists of some individual work, and we close it with a meeting.
Do you know how how I can wake it up? I've lost my screen. Never close your laptop.
Okay, first we're gonna gonna try some different things with the tools we have over here, so you get acquainted with these meeting tools. This is the presentation boards, wh which one I'm using right now. there's a document folder called the sh shared document folder. so you can do your PowerPoint presentations on this screen. There is a tool-bar over here. It's like a very simple paint application. and you can make new sheets by by pu puttin pressing on the blank button. and you can change the line width and the colour of the pen by pressing on forward, Right, we're gonna try out the electronic white-boards., every participant should draw his favourite animal and some of its favourite characteristics, Well, I'm gonna draw a p piranha., a fish. And so in the format menu you can choose the different colours and pen widths. but the easiest animal I can think is is a bird. and then we are through the tool training, I guess.
The User Interface Designer the technical functions design.
, some of the oje objectives are that is has to be original, trendy, and user-friendly.
And the Management Expert of the Marketing Expert. User requirements specifi
well, we're gonna brainstorm about what kind of kemoro romo remote control it's gonna be. I don't th I don't think the four of us got problems with remote controls, but if you see elderly people, all these buttons, and then they buy new T_V_ because their previous one was stolen or whatever., so I think what we need is is a clear remote control with grouped buttons, you know. And, is it gonna be a remote control that's what it can be used for different kind of equipment, like your T_V_ and your home stereo? Or someth something special, like M_P_ three player inside of it, or Okay. Maybe with different type of fronts or
Okay, this is something about the project finance. The selling price of our remote control is gonna be twenty five Euros. And our profit aim is fifteen million Euros. The market range is international, so it's gonna be sold world-wide, and the production cost should be a maximum of twelve Euro fifty per remote control.
The selling price of our remote control is gonna be twenty five Euros.
The the Industrial Designer will w or the working design, of course, The User Interface Designer the technical functions design. And the Management Expert of the Marketing Expert. User requirements specifi I'm gonna wri write some stuff down I'm gonna make some minutes or take some minutes. We'll see each other in thirty minutes.
and the production cost should be a maximum of twelve Euro fifty per remote control.
Well I was I was thinking since a T_V_ is mostly used together with a V_C_R_ or D_V_D_ player or recorder, and not with a stereo, I think it should be good to include functions for V_C_R_s and D_V_D_ players, recorders. I thought it was only for television. So so we probably don't have to have to have the functions for D_V_D_ player or V_C_R_. Yeah, but most television remote controls support other functions as well.
I'm gonna wri write some stuff down I'm gonna make some minutes or take some minutes.
, some of the oje objectives are that is has to be original, trendy, and user-friendly.
The the Industrial Designer will w or the working design, of course,
Well, I think that may be so, but well, we can't just leave the teletext button off. So the compromise we could make is just to make one teletext button, you know, like on and off, I think we should just put one teletext button on it.
I know that the younger people will most likely have a D_V_D_ player they want to, No, yeah, th th the user requirements of the the The new project requirements told us not to But just the basic functions. Maybe like rewind and wind, No, new requirements say no. Maybe if we just leave the D_V_D_ functional m
But i in a way we have to be special. Do you have you have you think about tha thought about that? How we can what the extra touch can be. Or maybe it w should have a big light that can flash or something on it, Maybe it should be a remote control when you you clap you hands it makes some noise or some gadget kind of thing. so maybe with with bouncing pads so that you can just throw it on the floor or something. a swapable front or whatever. Yeah, or just different colours would be I don't know if people also wanna spend more money on fronts for their remote control.
Welcome at the functional design meeting, again presented by Maarten., we've got three presentations. And I'm gonna show you some of the new projects requirements that were sent to me.
and I don't know if there are any if you put more functions, more buttons, maybe it's com becoming less trendy or something like that., I th I thought the the with less buttons you can make a more trendier
I in in the base we could like make a button, and if you push it, the remote control itself s makes noise. Yeah, you have to put it on its So it's like a vase or something you put on a table. If you do that, but I don't know if that's possible within the production cost of twelve and a half Euros. And then also you don't even need batteries, because you can make it chargeable. but when you you can imagine that when you spend twenty five Euros on a remote control and it's a basic remote control, then the then the money there must be money to spend on that kind of st you know, rechargeable units. Well, maybe yeah, you could when that's when it's too costly, you could probably skip the recharger, On the other hand, if you don't do it, we can also make a nice bay. I mean, it looks trendy and still still put a bleep function in it, And and what people just think about, well, I'll never have to buy any r batteries again, so y b because it's very annoying when your battery is empty.
Alright, I've done some research for functional requirements. there were hundred w h one hundred people, how do you say, f watched using remote controls in the usability lab and they also filled out a questionnaire with a few questions. So if we make a trendy design, we sure have seventy fi seventy five percent of the market, which you can reach., three out of four users zaps a lot, as I quoted here from the results. Furthermore, fifty percent says they only use ten percent of the buttons on a remote control. Fifty percent also claims to have lost a remote control very often in the room., all the settings, about audio settings, video settings and channel settings, which are not very often used, we could group them on one button and make them accessible in one menu button or whatever, And a trendy look, well, although seventy percent of the market is consists of elderly people who don't really care for trendy looks or whatever, I guess it can do no harm to make it trendy for the other thirty percent.
Well, they say tele teletext becomes outdated since the popularity of the internet. Well, I think that may be so, but well, we can't just leave the teletext button off. So the compromise we could make is just to make one teletext button, you know, like on and off, The remote control should only be used for television. Otherwise, the project becomes more complex, which endangers the time t t ma the time to market. Our product's corporate colour and slogan must be implemented in the new design.
If you do that, but I don't know if that's possible within the production cost of twelve and a half Euros. but when you you can imagine that when you spend twenty five Euros on a remote control and it's a basic remote control, then the then the money there must be money to spend on that kind of st you know, rechargeable units. Well, maybe yeah, you could when that's when it's too costly, you could probably skip the recharger,
So if we make a trendy design, we sure have seventy fi seventy five percent of the market, which you can reach., three out of four users zaps a lot, as I quoted here from the results. Fifty percent also claims to have lost a remote control very often in the room.
That means we can well d yeah, discuss on the remote control functions. Yeah, we we're looking for a really simple remote control with only basic T_V_ functions. I know that the younger people will most likely have a D_V_D_ player they want to, No, yeah, th th the user requirements of the the The new project requirements told us not to But just the basic functions. Maybe like rewind and wind, No, new requirements say no. Maybe if we just leave the D_V_D_ functional m Yeah, we we'll make w this one trendy. I think stop function is very useful. Yeah, yeah, but maybe you s yeah yeah, maybe y you do, but I've never heard of it in the first place. And I think we should just put one teletext button on it. I think the plus and the minus button should be quite present, No, okay, but we don't have to, when we don't want to control other devices, I think it makes it even more simple. the batteries maybe. If you use large batteries or small batter batteries. I think double A_. But i in a way we have to be special. Do you have you have you think about tha thought about that? How we can what the extra touch can be. Maybe it should be a remote control when you you clap you hands it makes some noise or some gadget kind of thing. Or maybe it w should have a big light that can flash or something on it, so maybe with with bouncing pads so that you can just throw it on the floor or something. So big buttons, flashy design, and maybe some kind of gadget kind of thing. a swapable front or whatever. Yeah, or just different colours would be I don't know if people also wanna spend more money on fronts for their remote control. I in in the base we could like make a button, and if you push it, the remote control itself s makes noise. Yeah, you have to put it on its So it's like a
Well, then we I'm gonna show you some of the new project requirements Well, they say tele teletext becomes outdated since the popularity of the internet. Well, I think that may be so, but well, we can't just leave the teletext button off. So the compromise we could make is just to make one teletext button, you know, like on and off, The remote control should only be used for television. Otherwise, the project becomes more complex, which endangers the time t t ma the time to market. New products should reach a new market with customers that are younger than forty. It's a very small market which we will approach then if we want to reach customers younger than forty. Yeah, but it is it's is a dif it's a fact that the th th that bigger market you're talking about, we already cover that. So maybe we can make a remote control that's primarily interesting for the younger group, but isn't that bad for an older person either. Our product's corporate colour and slogan must be implemented in the new design.
Has anyone got a little bit detailed ideas about the shape? Maybe like this pen. It has to feel nice in your hand. you should like make Alessi or something design it. Yeah, but twelve and a half Euros? I think it has to be a r it has to have round forms or something. Something like that is very ergonomic. And on th and then s a base unit underneath it. It's also round. Maybe, I don't know, some some lights, a big but well. Maybe lights also around the volume and the p the plus minus programme buttons. but I also meant the the blinking li w you know, the ones that also blink when you try to locate your remote. maybe put something on top of it or, you know, like that's looks funny. I think I think that'll be too big tha too big then.
'Kay, we're going to talk about working design. It's an electrical circuit which compose messages in the form of infrared signals to control the television., diodes, bat batteries and LED lights, they're needed and they're everywhere available., the circuit board, it's the most important part of the remote control.
I had some problems with the digitising the the first minutes, the the s the next minutes won't be a problem, but I'll try to make sure the first one will be in the folder too,
Well, the technical functions. and I think they're we have to focus on the one hand the expert view or the novice user. th I think it's it's very much depending on the user requirements, w if you want try a a a huge market, if you want to reach a huge market, like elderly people and we have to choose for novice user. well, there are l at least basic functions, like just th the channels one till nine, on and off switch, which must be clear with a red button or something like that., most standard have volume, of course, and a mute function, and, of course, the next and previous channel. and I don't know if there are any if you put more functions, more buttons, maybe it's com becoming less trendy or something like that., I th I thought the the with less buttons you can make a more trendier
We have lunch break, and then we have thirty minutes of individual work.
and I think they're we have to focus on the one hand the expert view or the novice user.
Yeah, we we're looking for a really simple remote control with only basic T_V_ functions. Yeah, we we'll make w this one trendy. But i in a way we have to be special. Do you have you have you think about tha thought about that? How we can what the extra touch can be.
well, there are l at least basic functions, like just th the channels one till nine, on and off switch, which must be clear with a red button or something like that., most standard have volume, of course, and a mute function, and, of course, the next and previous channel. three out of four people claim m to find remote controls ugly.
Well, maybe yeah, you could when that's when it's too costly, you could probably skip the recharger, well, we will see what's possible concerning the the costs, and if it's possible we'll do that.
Maybe just bring it out in different colours, but not af that you can switch fronts afterwards, that's also too much.
But wha th our basic idea y I mean, you gonna we're probably gonna have like two type of materials, like the d d b the plastic enclosure and then the the pads that surround it.
You'll see in you email, I guess. What are we going to do now?
Okay, we s skip the L_C_D_ display.
How many colours are we gonna give it? Like two-tone colour? T I think maybe the case itself should be in one colour and then the rubber of the buttons, and the cushions as well should be in another colour. Not more than two colours I think. It's a g a little bit too flashy. I think colours is very important, because it has to be flashy, but and but it d it doesn't have to be annoying, I think this is kind of fruity, you know. Just round shapes with
Okay, well I think the meeting will be over within a minute. Well, you will read the minutes in the you can find them in the In the shared folder. because I'm will now type them out. You'll see in you email, I guess. What are we going to do now?
But, from now on I won't use my pen anymore, so will be p just ordinary keyboard. Well, you will read the minutes in the you can find them in the In the shared folder. because I'm will now type them out.
But how do we use fruits and vegetables in Christ's sake with remote control? No, but I I I think that our design already resembles so a piece of fruit. Yeah, but it that doesn't have to remind you, you know, like explicitly of s our f of a of a specific piece of fruit, but just, you know, like the the the the round curves. Well, w we can w we can we can produce multiple multiple things. And, maybe, yeah, a b a banana is is n not easy for a remote control, but m yeah. yeah, I do like the f to the idea of making a a y, a catchy colour design and a d because I do I think a dark colour would be nice too. But pictures of fruit, vegetables vegetables Maybe it's too much, you know. But, we we have to There have to be the the the the firm colours, our own colours has to be in it. But I don't think our our company colours are this fashionable. If this is our docking station, we can make our logo over here. How many colours are we gonna give it? Like two-tone colour? T I think maybe the case itself should be in one colour and then the rubber of the buttons, and the cushions as well should be in another colour. Not more than two colours I think. It's a g a little bit too flashy. I think the spongy thing already comes forward in the in the in the cushions, pads and things on the s side. I think colours is very important, because it has to be flashy, but and but it d it doesn't have to be annoying, I think this is kind of fruity, you know. Just round shapes with
Well, it's nice, of course. But I don't I don't know what to display on it. do we want to use an L_C_D_ display, for example? Maybe maybe we can make a T_V_ guide on it, for the channel you're on. Yes sure, but it it has to to show an entire title of a programme or at least a q a quite quite large part of it and then you get a very large L_C_D_ screen, because Yeah, but no. I do I think it's a bit redundant, actually. Well well what would you display on it then?, programme information or or or or g or a guide But you're already watching the T_V_, you're not gonna watch your remote control. I really understand you want to make your job more exciting by putting an L_C_D_ in it, But I don't think a L_C_D_ display fits in that image. When when you put maybe a colour L_C_D_ t screen on it, it's very special and very trendy to have a remote control from well, I'm coming back to the costs again, but I think we gotta build a b pretty cheap design to to stay within our limits. and really, I don't see how the the L_C_D_ display is gonna add anything, you know, on a design level.
The younger market likes Well, the themes of of this year are surprisingly fruits and vegetables and spongy material., catchy colours. I think the spongy material is is very irritating for the remote control itself. To implement some spongy thing, maybe we can do it in the in the docking station. Yeah, also a bit for elderly people who are a little bit crazy and want maybe want a little younger design but still the dark colour.
do we want to use an L_C_D_ display, for example? Well, it's nice, of course. But I don't I don't know what to display on it. Maybe maybe we can make a T_V_ guide on it, for the channel you're on.

Okay, we s skip the L_C_D_ display.
The m material, I think it was a good idea to use the plastic and the rubber. But is it possible to use both the the plastic and so soft things and t p titanium, as well? But it it then it you can't throw it it. It will make a huge noise or break other stuff, I think titanium nowadays is way more often used than plastic. On the other hand, if you want to make fruit fruity stuff with
But how do we use fruits and vegetables in Christ's sake with remote control? No, but I I I think that our design already resembles so a piece of fruit. Yeah, but it that doesn't have to remind you, you know, like explicitly of s our f of a of a specific piece of fruit, but just, you know, like the the the the round curves.

But pictures of fruit, vegetables vegetables Maybe it's too much, you know. I think this is kind of fruity, you know. Just round shapes with
the most important thing is fancy look and feel of the remote control. The second important thing is innovative technology in the R_C_. And the third point there in this order if of importance, the third point, is a high ease of use.
Well, I've done some research again about trends on the internet. the most important thing is fancy look and feel of the remote control. The second important thing is innovative technology in the R_C_. And the third point there in this order if of importance, the third point, is a high ease of use. The younger market likes Well, the themes of of this year are surprisingly fruits and vegetables and spongy material., catchy colours. I think the spongy material is is very irritating for the remote control itself. To implement some spongy thing, maybe we can do it in the in the docking station. Yeah, also a bit for elderly people who are a little bit crazy and want maybe want a little younger design but still the dark colour.
And I thinked of the button sizes and I'm not sure if they have to be big or just small Well, w when we only use basic functions, we have the possibility to make the buttons larger. Well, I think we already agreed upon the fact that the the the skip buttons and the cha and the volume buttons, th th those two have yeah, they have to be large. It puts an extra accent on the the on the simplicity of our remotes to j to make these two most basic functions extra big, like t
, I still don't have any information about user requirements. I was thinking about just the basic functions and I got Oh, we decided upon that in the last meeting. Yeah, but but then wh I don't know when there are new user requirements. Well, tha I didn't receive any new requirements or somethi Well, I have here a couple of basic functions I could think of. these are the ones you already summed up in the, I was also looking for what you said, for I got an email about L_C_D_ in in in front of the remote control. I don't know if that's a good idea, or maybe it's a little bit too much for twelve and a half. Production. I d I ju I was just thinking about it. Then I got a pop-ups to go to the meeting. But, yeah. Well, the functions are are not more to discuss, I think. It's it's just the base things we already discussed that the no V_C_R_ or that kind of But you do mention the next and previous button. Well, that's next channel. I mean next channel. personal preference I didn't have. And I thinked of the button sizes and I'm not sure if they have to be big or just small
, another possibility. I yeah, I looked up on was the L_C_D_ displays. Could be something special to our remote control, and it's possible, but it only cost a bit more,
the basic battery, which I thi prefer because of its its non non-depending of of of here you have to have a hand yeah, kinetic energy., solar cells are also a bit weird for remote controls.
the the rubber double-curved case is a is a t three-dimensional curve in the in the design, which is necessary when we want to be trendy. I think that plastic is the is the best with rubber, because wood or titanium would also be a bit weird. Oh titanium is probably trendy, I think. Well, maybe a little bit expensive.
Th in that way we have like only the numbers, the power button, skip and volume, and then ten rem A mute and a teletext and a menu.
, yeah., before we begin it, I want to say I've I've put the minutes of the second meeting in the shared folder, It it still some technical difficulties so the the first part of the minutes are very hard to read, because there are two documents that were layered over each other. But, from now on I won't use my pen anymore, so will be p just ordinary keyboard.
Okay, when we talk about components design, it's really about the material and the and really the stuff we build the remote controls of. the properties of the case, it has to be solid in hard material like hard plastic with soft rubber for falling and and yeah, it feels good in your hand. I when we use a rubbled a doubled curved case, we must use a rubber push-buttons to the the rubber double-curved case is a is a t three-dimensional curve in the in the design, which is necessary when we want to be trendy. the basic battery, which I thi prefer because of its its non non-depending of of of here you have to have a hand yeah, kinetic energy., solar cells are also a bit weird for remote controls. I think that plastic is the is the best with rubber, because wood or titanium would also be a bit weird. Oh titanium is probably trendy, I think. Well, maybe a little bit expensive. the chip set and the board is all off the shelf. all the materials and the components are just available in in our factory., another possibility. I yeah, I looked up on was the L_C_D_ displays. Could be something special to our remote control, and it's possible, but it only cost a bit more, Yes, maybe we can bri bring a couple of couple of types of I th I got an email with some examples and it these were were the most trendiest one.
It w it won't tell, but No, this not gonna sell. No. Yeah, we just have to go all what we did today again. You have to do it over. No no there's still there's still someth concept and something special left. Yeah, and I would li I would have liked a kinetic part as well, to give it some just to give it some extra special feature,
Warning, finish meeting now. well, we were gonna what look take a look at the last sheet. No, we can't. Yeah, we have to Yeah, it's Yes, yes. Celebration.
we should know how many simple chips, regular chips The simple chip is e enough I I think, I haven't got an idea on on which we need to use, really. The the email I got said simple chip, but when we put in the speaker and the retriever device, it will cost a a bit more, like I think the advanced chip maybe. Maybe you can look it up right now. well, point out the advanced chip for now, I guess. Yeah, but it will it will it will be cause a lot of problems. But what can we do with the simple chip and what's difference with a regular chip and a advanced chip? Maybe you can find it in your email right now, I've got a schematic view of the remote control, but nothing about advanced chips or You can look at it for s presentation. I don't think here it's in here already. Was it working design or components design? You know that a push-button requires a simple chip, but a scroll-wheel, it it me requires Okay, so we only need a simple chip. it s only states that a scroll-wheel requires a regular chip, and that a display requires an advanced chip.
, I think you have to indicate the amount of push-buttons we want to use, Well that's bit of a problem, because I re but I really don't understand that, because I can imagine a remote control with far more push-buttons, and it wouldn't be possible according to this sheet. it's only when you use push-buttons, it will cost that much. Maybe it's the kind of push-buttons. You can have f four kind of push-buttons. And plus these two, f plus the mute button, and it's will be eighteen. Why is that so expensive. Yeah, I don't understand. Well, okay, well well let's make it just one. I I I couldn't understand it if it was fifty cents per per button. Really. I've seen one one remote control with only the pu yeah, only with page up, page down and volume, Yeah, but I d I wouldn't want to own that. Really., it's it's still for little children.
then the docking station isn't relevant for this project anymore, No, but you otherwise you can't retrieve it. I mean if it's a simple chip, then we suddenly got two Euros and thirty cents. But for two Euros and thirty cents, we we don't get a docking station. if it would cost two Euros, that had a total a total thing, it would be nice too, yeah, but when we skip when we when we don't use the do we're not gonna make the docking station, then we still yeah, we need something else maybe to make it kind of special, We can make a plain docking station for two Euros. Wi wi without recharge I think we can make a docking station. Yeah. We can make a docking station for two thirty. Yeah, but be serious, then the docking station will be a fifth of the price of the remote control. but we we don't inc we haven't looked at the these costs of the speaker and other stuff. We can really can do the docking thing, Then we have one Euro thirty for the whole docking station. No no, it's not possible.
or we can ki do the kinetic cells. maybe I think maybe the kinetic thing is something. Instead of the rechargeable Kinetics aren't nowadays only used in watches and that's because you're always walking. the target group are people who zap regularly and throw with their remote control as a matter of speaking. Hey that maybe that's cool that's a cool thing about it, you know. You don't use batteries. maybe it with the kinetic thing, I think we could do do a compromise with the kim kinetic thing. Maybe we can do it both in the in the in the remote. Battery and kinetic. You you gotta throw throw it through the room like twenty times an hour, really., a watch is kinetic because you walk all the time. Because I think the d whole dynamic part, do you know, appeals to me qui thinking of our design philosophy, you know, with the rubber parts and sturdiness of the thing, and y when you move it around a lot, then people find the idea funny that when I move my remote control around and Yeah, it's funny for a week. Okay, then we d Okay, well y we don't have to do it, but what that would just have a lack of key features, you know.
But maybe we can maybe we can make the docking station a bit standard for for the other products we sell, because Real Real Reaction sells more products than only remote controls. So maybe we can use the docking station, for example, M_P_ three players or or I think that's very difficult, because of different shapes of devices. Yes, but when you put that same volt voltages on it, you can put when the when the when o the the the lowest part of it, when it's o the same as the other products, you can put it all on the same The technology and the voltage can be the same. That's that's true. When when the the recharger has a has a bit what points out, we can place all on top of it. Shouldn't it fall then? It isn't going to fall down? No, when you make it large enough no it it will not. But it's just an idea. It's leaning. It's leaning backwards, I think, in the in the docking station. Well let's ha let's talk about the docking station later, because maybe we have we have to consider the docking station anyway, because we have some cost issues still to come.
It's something we really put work into. Yeah well, let that let's make that a one. Yeah, maybe it really depends on taste. Okay, three. I would say a one because every button is relevant. I think we totally succeeded there. Well maybe a two, because of the menu button or something. Also, the the the buttons of the one, the two, the the digits, The remote control has got a really trendy look. Yeah, a t I think a two. we've tried to make it the the best trendy look ever. But I do think that it's more trendy than beautiful. You agree on the two? No, not L_C_D_, so. you mean the rubber stuff? But that that's not innovative. Or seven maybe, yeah. With the lights it it's it's kind of future Yes. The docking station is a is a little bit innovative. Well, let's leave it open for for us later to see what, because we have to reevaluate anyway. No, well, the agenda says evaluate now, so I think we how would you innovate a remote control more? Yeah, more through like function T_V_ functionalities and But I d I definitely don't think it's a five, think about it la later on Yeah, a two. Yeah. Definitely. Yeah, a two. Yeah, you can put that on the side if if we would like to. Yeah, and I will I th still think it's gonna be a two or a three. Yeah, make it a two.
It's a two point six. which is quite a great score.
First of all, the all the docking station and costs and such are not included in this list. 'Kay, but the problem now is that the There's no such thing as a docking station in this list, but we can all imagine that it would be impossible to make a docking station for thirty cents. But we can sell the remote control and sell the docking station then the docking station isn't relevant for this project anymore,
becau b l a lot of remote controls work that y when y that you when you fir you push the one first, then you have a couple of seconds I think you should add A cross, or whatever. Yeah, line. but do we have do we need extra buttons, All n no, that's kinda dependent on the television., there are different ways for remote controls to do like d I call it teens and twenties. No, that's dependent on the television. I know some remote controls that don't have these buttons, but you still can, know, obviously you can still select the twenty a number in the twenty or in the ten. Yes, but no remote control nowadays are they come with the television. when when you put a button on it with like one and then a dash, it's the same thing as when you just push the one, some televisions don't accept that that When you push the button, the remote control gives a signal. and when y whe when you don't push another button on the remote control within five seconds, then the remote control gives a signal for channel one. it it it works if you haven't got a special button for it, if you push a one, then on your television there will appear a one and a a line, which is an empty space. Yeah, but it's exact the same that w would appear when you put a separate button push a separate button. Yes, but some some old televisions you have to click on a special button, then you go to a a next level, you can push two buttons. Yeah, but you don't underst you don't understand my point. that special but button you're talking about,? That's just a signal to recei ju they send a t signal to the v tv T_V_ that they have to put a one in on your screen and a dash, which you can pu so you can still put another number on it. When you don't have that separate button, and you push y one
I think we gotta fill out another questionnaire, to be honest.
So we're gonna use the simple chip.
Okay, then we d Okay, well y we don't have to do it, but what that would just have a lack of key features, you know.
No no, it's not possible.
First of all, the all the docking station and costs and such are not included in this list. we should know how many simple chips, regular chips The simple chip is e enough I I think, I haven't got an idea on on which we need to use, really. The the email I got said simple chip, but when we put in the speaker and the retriever device, it will cost a a bit more, like I think the advanced chip maybe. Maybe you can look it up right now. well, point out the advanced chip for now, I guess. Yeah, but it will it will it will be cause a lot of problems. Well that's bit of a problem,, I think you have to indicate the amount of push-buttons we want to use, because I re but I really don't understand that, because I can imagine a remote control with far more push-buttons, and it wouldn't be possible according to this sheet. it's only when you use push-buttons, it will cost that much. Maybe it's the kind of push-buttons. You can have f four kind of push-buttons. And plus these two, f plus the mute button, and it's will be eighteen. Why is that so expensive. Yeah, I don't understand. Well, okay, well well let's make it just one. I I I couldn't understand it if it was fifty cents per per button. Really. I've seen one one remote control with only the pu yeah, only with page up, page down and volume, Yeah, but I d I wouldn't want to own that. Really., it's it's still for little children. 'Kay, but the problem now is that the There's no such thing as a docking station in this list, but we can all imagine that it would be impossible to make a docking station for thirty cents. But we can sell the remote control and sell the docking station then the docking station isn't relevant for this project anymore, No, but you otherwise you can't retrieve it. I mean if it's a simple chip, then we suddenly got two Euros
or we can ki do the kinetic cells. maybe I think maybe the kinetic thing is something. Instead of the rechargeable Kinetics aren't nowadays only used in watches and that's because you're always walking. the target group are people who zap regularly and throw with their remote control as a matter of speaking. Hey that maybe that's cool that's a cool thing about it, you know. You don't use batteries. maybe it with the kinetic thing, I think we could do do a compromise with the kim kinetic thing. Maybe we can do it both in the in the in the remote. Battery and kinetic. You you gotta throw throw it through the room like twenty times an hour, really., a watch is kinetic because you walk all the time. Because I think the d whole dynamic part, do you know, appeals to me qui thinking of our design philosophy, you know, with the rubber parts and sturdiness of the thing, and y when you move it around a lot, then people find the idea funny that when I move my remote control around and Yeah, it's funny for a week. Okay, then we d Okay, well y we don't have to do it, but what that would just have a lack of key features, you know.
Then we have one Euro thirty for the whole docking station. No no, it's not possible.
Warning, finish meeting now. well, we were gonna what look take a look at the last sheet. No, we can't. Yeah, we have to Yeah, it's Yes, yes. Celebration.
I received a spreadsheet. I'm gonna open the spreadsheet and we're gonna work this out together, First of all, the all the docking station and costs and such are not included in this list. We include one battery. we we indicate the amount of components of the specif specific component, how much we need of them. we should know how many simple chips, regular chips The simple chip is e enough I I think, The the email I got said simple chip, but when we put in the speaker and the retriever device, it will cost a a bit more, like I think the advanced chip maybe. Maybe you can look it up right now. well, point out the advanced chip for now, I guess. Yeah, but it will it will it will be cause a lot of problems. Okay, we went for the double-curved case made out of plastic and rubber. And with a special colour. Otherwise, you get a standard plastic colour. Yeah, I think we we have special colours. Okay, then the push-button, I was just counting them., I think you have to indicate the amount of push-buttons we want to use, Well that's bit of a problem, because I re but I really don't understand that, because I can imagine a remote control with far more push-buttons, and it wouldn't be possible according to this sheet. it's only when you use push-buttons, it will cost that much. Maybe it's the kind of push-buttons. You can have f four kind of push-buttons. And plus these two, f plus the mute button, and it's will be eighteen. Why is that so expensive. Yeah, I don't understand. Well, okay, well well let's make it just one. I I I couldn't understand it if it was fifty cents per per button. Really. I've seen one one remote control with only the pu yeah, only with page up, page down and volume, Yeah, but I d I wouldn't want to own that. Really., it's it's still for little children. But then still, when we there's no room for a docking station or
'Kay, we've made a prototype. especially we looked at the form, material and the colour. The logo is is is pretty obvious to see on the on the remote control, I think the most of the functions are obvious. did we want to have a m mute button? Alright, and you gotta point out which is the volume button and which is the programme button. Yeah, but you you gotta make it clear on the on Next to that I kinda miss a zero actually. I think it's pretty basic, there's one there's one button, the f the look and feel would be great on this remote control, because you always will pick up the remote control in the in the smallest area. Then your left thumb of your right thumb is near the programme button, which is the most common used function, Yes, we can make also n neon lights on it, or or the buttons that can make light on it.
the volume at the side, and the other side is the programmes. And then we had just two buttons, we place them in the middle, the menu, and for the teletext then the the the nine channels., power button. we'll apply them then for now. I don't know I don't know if if it's it's necessary.
Okay, welcome to the detailed design meeting. Oh, we're gonna have a prototype presentation first.
Yes, on the side there will be a strip of rubber, and in the middle there is a hard a hard material, a bit hard plastic with a light behind it. because we're gonna use one colour for the the plastic enclosure and one colour for the rubber, Then we're gonna do the buttons in the i are we're gonna have rubber buttons., in the same colour as the side. But, and we have to agree upon the exact colours,
Right, we're gonna evaluate that design according to a few points., we g the four of us are going to do that together. we we gotta give points to to all of these to evaluate that design, The remote control is not ugly. How do you feel? Yeah, maybe it really depends on taste. I think I think the the fronts will give it a more less uglier side, because you can make it in your own No, not not fronts, but different designs. Okay, three. The remote control's that n makes zapping easy. Yeah well, let that let's make that a one. It's something we really put work into. The remote control the remote control's relevant buttons are prominently visible. Yeah, but we d we didn't we're we're not planning to use fronts, I believe. I would say a one because every button is relevant. The remote control hasn't got too much redundant or unneeded buttons. I think we totally succeeded there. Well maybe a two, because of the menu button or something. Also, the the the buttons of the one, the two, the the digits, The remote control has got a really trendy look. Yeah, a t I think a two. we've tried to make it the the best trendy look ever. But I do think that it's more trendy than beautiful. You agree on the two? Remote control has got innovative technology implanted. No, not L_C_D_, so. you mean the rubber stuff? But that that's not innovative. Or seven maybe, yeah. With the lights it it's it's kind of future Yes. The docking station is a is a little bit innovative. Well, let's leave it open for for us later to see what, because we have to reevaluate anyway. No, well, the agenda says evaluate now, so I think we how would you innovate a remote control more? Yeah, more through like function T_V_ functionalities and But I d I definitely don't think it's a five, think about it la later on Remote control is easy to use. Yeah, a two. It will be bought by people under
, there are different ways for remote controls to do like d I call it teens and twenties. All n no, that's kinda dependent on the television. but do we have do we need extra buttons, I think you should add A cross, or whatever. Yeah, line. Yeah, but you don't you don't actually need them, becau b l a lot of remote controls work that y when y that you when you fir you push the one first, then you have a couple of seconds No, that's dependent on the television. I know some remote controls that don't have these buttons, but you still can, know, obviously you can still select the twenty a number in the twenty or in the ten. Yes, but no remote control nowadays are they come with the television. when when you put a button on it with like one and then a dash, it's the same thing as when you just push the one, some televisions don't accept that that When you push the button, the remote control gives a signal. and when y whe when you don't push another button on the remote control within five seconds, then the remote control gives a signal for channel one. it it it works if you haven't got a special button for it, if you push a one, then on your television there will appear a one and a a line, which is an empty space. Yeah, but it's exact the same that w would appear when you put a separate button push a separate button. Yes, but some some old televisions you have to click on a special button, then you go to a a next level, you can push two buttons. Yeah, but you don't underst you don't understand my point. that special but button you're talking about,? That's just a signal to recei ju they send a t signal to the v tv T_V_ that they have to put a one in on your screen and a dash, which you can pu so you can still put another number on it. When you
but I still think i it it all T_V_s in some ways support it, But maybe we can maybe we can make the docking station a bit standard for for the other products we sell, because Real Real Reaction sells more products than only remote controls. So maybe we can use the docking station, for example, M_P_ three players or or I think that's very difficult, because of different shapes of devices. Yes, but when you put that same volt voltages on it, you can put when the when the when o the the the lowest part of it, when it's o the same as the other products, you can put it all on the same The technology and the voltage can be the same. That's that's true. When when the the recharger has a has a bit what points out, we can place all on top of it. Shouldn't it fall then? It isn't going to fall down? No, when you make it large enough no it it will not. But it's just an idea. It's leaning. It's leaning backwards, I think, in the in the docking station. Well let's ha let's talk about the docking station later, because maybe we have we have to consider the docking station anyway, because we have some cost issues still to come.
So we all are going to draw a nice animal on this board, We going to try it. Alright, your favourite animal? I'm just going to well draw a nice beast I hope this was part of the assignment and not your personal enjoyment. the first the first meeting is just a bit loose, loosen up, a bit meeting each other We're kinda losing time, though. It's a hedgehog. and now our Industrial Designer can draw its most favourite animal. It's a rabbit. save it and start a new These are very important documents, of course, these drawings, Yeah well we have to save everything There's also different colours and different well pen widths the line the the thickness thickness. It's just a bird. you choose a new colour. And a new pen width also format. It's a cat.
Well then the serious stuff. We're we want to sell it at twenty five Euros internationally so but we dunno what exactly th i it is in dollars, but twenty five Euros. Our profit aim is, worldwide, fifty million Euros. So I didn't exactly calculate how much we have to sell. we want to keep it our costs at twelve and a half Euros so, keep that in mind when we talk about our materials an f and stuff, and marketing research. Now then we all we can sit down and discuss what do we think about our current remote controls, first about design about aim in the market etcetera? Well who has some remarks about the current remote controls? Well I I didn't have to prepare anything about it's not, it's it's not my task to talk about experience with current remote controls, Well just w we're four if we if we would just have one then
I've made a presentation but I'll open it on the Smartboard, so we can all see it. Well this is called the the the kick-off meeting. So I'm the Project Manager, And an a nice agenda. we'll do the opening and then we'll meet each other, I'll I'll show you the the tools we have here, so that we can all use them. We'll discuss about our first ideas about the project, and then we'll close the meeting, and then we can individually do our things and then we'll get back here. We have to design a new television remote control. we want it to be original, so a nice a nice new design. trendy, it's also for young people, and we have to just make it modern. And friendly, so size does matter. And Well it has to be a have the the right the right buttons on the right place, that kin those kind of things. There happen to be three stages. functional, conceptual, and d detailed design. so every time we we'll do some individual work, get meeting, talk about it, and then go into the next phase. We have these two Smartboards. well as I just showed, there's a project management folder, a project document folder on the desktop. It just works exactly the same as a computer. You just click on the on the folder and you open the everything you you put in it with your laptop. and the w the r the rest also works the same so when you open a notepad you you just get your things, This is a well a drawing board. you have a these different functions on the board. So you have a a nice pen, and it's works just like a bal ball pen. Of course w doesn't work any more. We can well you can save a file. So if we draw we have to save everything. just we can start a new one, and we just go on, and don't throw anything away. you can here select a pen, It's a bit childish you have
so I think individually we'll have to come up with ideas for the next meeting about these materials and markets etcetera. Well it's just about our first ideas now
Are we going w with the front fronts idea? Well I think w we can look into that in the in the next thirty minutes.
Well our user interface you can maybe I don't know what your specific instructions will be, but probably about the precision of the buttons and and those kind of things and what buttons will have to be on the remote.
It has to be different and familiar at the same time. we could use another form or shape or colour, that kind of things. I thought about like most remote controls are a long box shaped thing you can make it triangle shaped, but that's not very recognisable. Well we we could make more more oval or something, and and N we can use it as a as a game pad. So one hand has the beer, so the other hand but young people want something different Yeah but it's quite important that it fits. one of our aims is that it has to be original and trendy so Well there has been done a lot of researches about remotes we have to we can imagine so the long box shaped thing must be, yeah, useful for me personally I have a a lot of remotes at home but those ones that have a a round ending and well just an square middle I don't like to use them. When it falls over it and I just have and then the button that I use most has to be here. It shouldn't be boxy. I don't agree with the long box shape But it does fit in the hand if you hold it like this, and you can make it another shape, No if y if you look at new Phillips D_V_D_ with their remotes pl players they they are the new remotes aren't box shaped. No that's ol old fashioned. Well most of of them are are somewhat thicker at the end, and get yeah thinner towards the the other end. but then with some round round forms in it to fit your hand, A it h it has it it has a that's tha th th shape that it fits your hand. It shouldn't be too boxy, you know. but no no I don't mean an entire box like completely square but a also with round edges of course, but in in in at the end it's still this long box shape with convenient round shapes to fit. A
Well it's just about our first ideas now so I think individually we'll have to come up with ideas for the next meeting about these materials and markets etcetera.
Yeah maybe we can just like on cell phones those well you can you can put on on them, and so you can customise your your own remote with different colours or or special paint jobs That's kinda trendy. Sound nice. Yes. I think we have to talk also about the the materials for Well it's just about our first ideas now so I think individually we'll have to come up with ideas for the next meeting about these materials and markets etcetera. I think it's it's important to notate all the the decisions that we make, You'll get specific instructions when you're back in your room so it's logical. I think. So we'll just get a notice that the the meeting is over. Yeah now we can still talk about the material, I w wrote down that the case should be plastic of course, hard plastic, the buttons should be rubbery I think. Yeah it shouldn't be too heavy. Well I have had remotes that they had the function of the buttons was about a layer over the buttons Are we going w with the front fronts idea? Well I think w we can look into that in the in the next thirty minutes. and you can always use a front front on it, you know? You can use it just plain but you can To make it more trendy. And we should dispatch those kind of fronts fronts a a around the world so Well you can make profit with them, and it's a way to make them trendy. Well but th but the standard front will be just grey or something Yeah well it has to it h it has to fit the the te television and D_V_D_ set we are going to sell, so if they are black and black black and silver we'll make them black and silver so But people of often don't like bright colours or something. We have to make it grey or s or black. But that's marketing research you can you can ask. And you will look into the technical design
I think it's im it's important to look at the remote controls of our competitors. Get the good points try to merge them into one universal remote control. On our corporate site I saw a new D_V_D_ player we're gonna produce. Maybe it's important to make it compatible with the D_V_D_ player we should make it compatible perhaps with everything we use, we we make? and maybe we do we even have more than just a D_V_D_ player. And stereo s audio installations. And I think the people who who will buy our remote already have some experience with remotes. because we look at competitors and w if we pick up the good things about that and give it a nice design
Furthermore it's important to make it acceptable for the whole world, for different cultures, maybe, because we want to we want to well fifty million? No but the b the buttons have to have to have international recognisable buttons and and numbers and that every culture in, yeah, people in every country can recognise. I also think we should not add too many buttons. Modern day remotes have too much buttons I think. Y y you don't use the half of them that's that's Maybe we could make one button to switch between D_V_D_ player and T_V_ and make the other buttons multi-functional or something. so it doesn't become too complicated with too much buttons and
and and that the less important buttons, like the the the different channels, the numbers one two three four five as well, should be yeah well not in reach, We have a power button, setting buttons, L_C_D_ window, the number buttons Channel, yeah. Volume control. the mute button. Oh you always have in the centre an Okay button, for your menu. Menu button. Yeah. I think that's important.
and the design comes into the next round?
so that it becomes more user-friendly, So we have to change a little bit to that, I like user-centr centred also the best.
And if if that's gives you a little bit of sta status information. No not clickable. well I think so, yes. Alright, we go with the L_C_D_ screen?
Furthermore, it's seventy five per cent of the users zaps a lot. A lot of losers users lose their controls in their in their living room. thirty four thirty four per cent thinks it's it's too too difficult to learn.
And the the user interface sends the the different signals of the different buttons to the chip, The chip produces Morse code, a specific code to indicate that specific button that is pressed, of course. Now the LED produces an infrared beam and signals the, well it's very simple, and signals the signals to the sensor on the T_V_ set,
because especially for the third requirement we want to reach people under the thirty years.
They also say, that's about I thought it was fifty per cent, that more money will be spent on better looking controls. research shows that they like to have a little L_C_D_ screen on their on their zapping device. And another thing is speech recognition. They also like that,
But you you can put two or three buttons under another section. Th that's a bit waste. I do think we have to put that underneath a clip.
But I think it's very important to make the power, channel and volume buttons near to the thumb, so you can't have R_S_I_ consequences. but the most important buttons m maybe you can just put them a bit apart so you would reject R_ R_S_I_ R_S_I_. That's very irritating, I think. Yeah, but what he said about R_S_I_ was t kinda true. I think we we should use something like this to The the channel up and channel down button? Yeah, in circle, you know? So it might be smarter to put them a little more away from each other. Yeah but people don't like it when their buttons are all over the place. So the the channel channel buttons should be far far apart, I think, up and down. No I don't think. I think you can have the two buttons of up and down close together, but you don't have have to have volume control and and zapping button close together.
So we have to change a little bit to that, so that it becomes more user-friendly, I like user-centr centred also the best.
now the new project requirements, I'll just show them. Well, teletext goes out. and they don't want it, Well and our corporate image should stay rec recognisable in our products.
And if if that's gives you a little bit of sta status information. No not clickable. Alright, we go with the L_C_D_ screen? well I think so, yes.
We have a power button, setting buttons, L_C_D_ window, the number buttons Channel, yeah. Volume control. the mute button. Oh you always have in the centre an Okay button, for your menu. Menu button. Yeah. I think that's important.
Alright so no button for that. Are we going to do it like on Mike's screen with one button that says I'm going to do a t two number digital?
research shows that they like to have a little L_C_D_ screen on their on their zapping device. It's going to be expensive. Yeah. I don't have any information on that. So I think that's difficult to realise also. And another thing is speech recognition., research has shown that it's a high interested in features. Like L_C_D_ screens and voice recognition. Yeah well we we we still need to know how much that will cost.
I think it should be at the top. Yeah but with with the L_C_D_ screen on the top it gets a bit unnatural. because when when when I use a remote I l I hate the buttons but buttons at the at the bottom. We don't want them to look like a calculator. I think it's still important to have it at the top,
and we'll have to decide s things on our own I think. So
So it's better to put our attention to the the design. So you can pick up and use it, than I think.
But I think it's very important to make the power, channel and volume buttons near to the thumb, so you can't have R_S_I_ consequences. but the most important buttons m maybe you can just put them a bit apart so you would reject R_ R_S_I_ R_S_I_. That's very irritating, I think. I think we we should use something like this to The the channel up and channel down button? Yeah, in circle, you know? Yeah, but what he said about R_S_I_ was t kinda true. So it might be smarter to put them a little more away from each other. Yeah but people don't like it when their buttons are all over the place. So the the channel channel buttons should be far far apart, I think, up and down. No I don't think. I think you can have the two buttons of up and down close together, but you don't have have to have volume control and and zapping button close together.
I think we should go further with the idea of a removable front. but i th they all have to have something about the recognition from our company.
And the button that you can go to A_V_ for your video. Yeah, but you can z you can zap t you can you can zap to the video channel from zero to
Can you draw it now?
And then below is the L_C_D_ screen? Those are the the cha the channel buttons of course? Yeah, fine. And oh I think as you can see so, the L_C_D_ screen does look better at the lower end, or at the bottom.
But we need a we need a a recording recording button for the speech part. if we decide to to implement that, maybe we should. Well the speaker and the microphone, I think, are the same little hole thingy.
furthermore material, that's your part, should be very strong. I was thinking of something like well iron plate over it,
the buttons of course rubber, I suggest the basic battery. But solar energy is not very practical inside a house, And kinetic and and and dynamos are are not very practical, I think, for for a simple remote, f as for the buttons, simple push buttons. No otherwi no difficult scroll things or some things like that, so we we do have to consider of we have to use a more advanced chip,
it's not really speech recognition, and then once you talk to the remote, then he will a answer with the the prerecorded message that you left. No it doesn't does not do anything.
they like soft materials with primary colours. And also they like curved round shapes.
and then once you talk to the remote, then he will a answer with the the prerecorded message that you left. it's not really speech recognition, No it doesn't does not do anything.
When you want an other colour on the front, it doesn't match. and it doesn't really matter if we have a purple front on it or a orange front. but you know b Titanium is very basic colour,
Well yeah. I think a logo, our company logo, and the slogan should be or could be I I'd say only the logo. Well, our slogan is not very long. But you can put it on the back, the logo should be on the top I think. Right corner, yes. Yes, slogan from company on the back with logo and logo also on the front
Well a case? that's me. Yeah but the non-removable elements of the of the remote, so not the front, could be titanium, And then the front is made of plastic. Titanium back, plastic front. Okay. Will we use round buttons or square ones for the for the numbers? Yeah. Round.
So a little corner of titanium.
all the all the inside work of our remote is standard work.
I think we can launch a couple of packages. Launch different lines at once. Yeah but you you can have some basic colours,
But you can put it on the back, the logo should be on the top I think. Right corner, yes. Yes, slogan from company on the back with logo and logo also on the front
Soft materials is of course agai again a bit a contradiction with our material choice of what you said,
Y Hard plastic i is of course pretty pretty tough, but it doesn't have a really really tough look. So But the feel of plastic isn't strong.
Well the the handy thing about our fronts is that we can follow these trends e ev every year. Yeah, that's great.
Well, as I said earlier I think the L_C_D_ screen should be positioned at the lower end of the remote. Those are the the cha the channel buttons of course? And then below is the L_C_D_ screen? And oh I think as you can see so, the L_C_D_ screen does look better at the lower end, or at the bottom. Yeah, fine.
the buttons for screen width and general settings and and that kind of stuff
Maybe a a cheap voice recording. We all agree on that. Yeah.
It's very important that the control is fancy looking and good feeling., technological technological innovations, that's regarded very highly too. the last point is easy to use.
Well a case? that's me. Yeah but the non-removable elements of the of the remote, so not the front, could be titanium, And then the front is made of plastic. Titanium back, plastic front. Okay.
So it must be very bright, very colourful. Fruit and vegetables are cool. Well the the handy thing about our fronts is that we can follow these trends e ev every year.
I think we can launch a couple of packages. Launch different lines at once.
Industry designer,. User Interface, Mike. You're going to work together on a prototype drawing on the SMARTboard.
I don't know what product evaluation exactly means,
the buttons of course rubber, I think everyone agrees.
so we we do have to consider of we have to use a more advanced chip, But we do use an L_C_D_ screen,
And of course this low part, this is the L_C_D_ screen.
I'm going to do the ev evaluation.
which is made which is also part of the back, part of the titanium titanium part. And we thought about the logo big in the middle. And the company slogan, we thought in a kind of arc shape above the logo.
I think oval will be better for the for the d for the different channel buttons. the the con the the the, yeah, the t volume and the channel controls in the middle here. with kind of arrow shapes, And the video button. Menu for the L_C_D_ screen.
That's gonna be done at the end of seven point skill criteria. the first question is, is the device good-looking? Easy to change channels? The device is easy to find if you lose it? Are there enough technology? Are the trends about fruit and vegetables implemented? Is the material attractive?
look at the costs at this point. The sample speaker, Kick it out. So we have to use the ditch the titanium, I'm afraid.
Why why don't we replace the titanium with plastic coloured titanium, Th then you have a ugly, stupid, l ugly looking, dumb remote that that no-one would buy.
Yeah, we need to have the the L_C_D_ screen. But we d Then we have to lose the L_C_D_ screen. Hey but I think you'll agree that that we that now we have this screen, it's it's very not practical to ha to consider this after we have designed the entire thing.
The sample speaker, Kick it out.
And of course this low part, this is the L_C_D_ screen. Well the the Well that's a reason to to to put the L_C_D_ screen of course on the upper side, but Well f for as far as I can see, three of us agree and only Nils So let it be like this at at this moment.
a green board with chalk is much more useful than that thing.
well what do you, what did you think about the SMARTboard? It was a complete disaster.
Well we make it more expensive to buy. Well, then we have two dollars less profit. I'll put in the report we that we think that fourteen point one is the l m lowest price you can make a remote for that's trendy d these days.
but now we're going to evaluate our project, of project, are we satisfactory about our creativity? Well in in if we consider the costs then this is the best, yeah. leadership Well it's It was very democratic. Well the managers were terrible. So, with their all their useless requirements. teamwork? Well great I think. well what do you, what did you think about the SMARTboard? It was a complete disaster. And the digi the digital pen? Yeah, it might be useful for drawings. I I agree on that.
Kick it out. Then we go to fourteen point six. The sample speaker,
and only Nils Well the the Well that's a reason to to to put the L_C_D_ screen of course on the upper side, but
If if you look if if this this is thick, and this is thin, th th then it that it lies over your hands. But
So we have to use the ditch the titanium, I'm afraid.
We have of course the the round shape the round basic shape. Th So there's this part which is made of hard plastic, the front. And we're we're using different colours.
and the rest of it, the under the under side of it, yeah, the back side and the lower part of the front is of course titanium made of titanium,
this is our design.
The first kick-off meeting. First the opening, then the rest. We m have to make a new remote control. It has to be original, trendy and user-friendly. So we will get back th on that. First we have to make a functional design. After that we have to make a conceptual design, and then after that a detailed design. So we'll discuss that later.
For our own remote control we have to think how do we make it. So what ideas do you have for it, for the new remote control? The weight. Not not too heavy. Not much buttons. That when you drop it, it won't break. Like some kind of rubber on it. Or hard hard plastic. something like when you lose your remote control, sometimes it happen. it between the couch and you can't find it. When you push a but a button on the T_V_, then you hear some some sort of bleep. Yeah well that's that are good ideas. And looking on the budget, not too expensive material. So probably plastic or something. Yeah I think it from a marketing point of view, it also has to look nice. on our website we can see what products we already have. And it should work with as many as possible of them. it it won't take a lot of batteries. So you don't won't have to change the batteries once a week or once every two weeks.

Yeah I think it from a marketing point of view, it also has to look nice. on our website we can see what products we already have. And it should work with as many as possible of them. it it won't take a lot of batteries. So you don't won't have to change the batteries once a week or once every two weeks.
So first to we have to make a small painting. First you can save the documents. We have to do that every time we make something. And we have to use the pen and the eraser. We all have to use this one. So I'll make an example. you can change some things. format, line, and change it. And you can change the colour. So and after it you have to save it. An elephant. So you're next. a bird. Now save? Okay.
First I wanna hear from you. what are your experiences with remote controls. Big one, they are not easy to use. And g big buttons, m that's easier to use than I think. Big buttons, positive. well I think the the the goal of a remote control is that it's it it has an influence on the T_V_ set. And that it controls the channels and the the volume. And I I I think it's positive if there's a a LED a LED on the corner of the of the remote. And that if you push the button the LED gives a light, and and you see that it's working. But I my my experience is that it it it's convenient to have that. at home we have a T_V_, a video recorder, a D_V_D_ player, and a satellite receiver. We have four distinctive remote controls for that. That's not really ea easy. So it would be nice if we have one for all.
If we aim for the younger people, and there will be a lot of features like L_C_D_ or the the the speech f recognising, the cost will be a lot of h a lot higher. I think we don't have that in our budget. And I don't I don't think twenty five Euros for a remote is really cheap or something. So it's Yeah, it's hard to get the younger group. I think the L_C_D_ is cheaper than speech recognition. we go back on the decisions later. So I think that can be an d good option. L_C_D_.
Then it's your turn, the marketing expert. So I'm gonna have a presentation about the market, we did a usability lab-test with a hundred persons. And we looked at several things. among them design, what frustrations they had while using remote controls. our users, they disliked the look and feel of current remote controls. they especially found found them very ugly. And th they also found them hard to to learn how to use it. well they also zap a lot. And fifty percent of the users only use ten percent of the buttons. So a lot of unused buttons. Well the most used button is the channel selection. The power, volume and channel selections are very relevant. teletext is less relevant but also important. not important they found the audio, that's not the volume but specific the the pitch, or the left or right. the screen and the brightness. And channel settings. th and they also are not used very often. here we can see what the market share is of several groups. Then we have a few graphs about the market. as you can see, most users are between thirty six and forty five. the the the younger group between sixteen and twenty five is not very big. And to come back on the the swapping things, I don't think, I I think the younger will be most interest in it. in the we asked them, how would you like a s a new feature. If you have an L_C_D_ on the remote control, what would you think of it. Now you can clearly see young users say. I will that would very nice. And older user think they will be scared of change I think. And another thing, how would you like to have a speech recognition on it. Young users think that's an interesting idea. And old users not. well we found out that there are two several markets at which we can aim. the first are the younger, the age between sixteen and forty five. they are highly interested in the features, as you can see
Yes well I shall give a short talk about the the technical function design. I thought the the the technical function design was to for a remote control to to to have some influence on the T_V_ set. And well, it all by pushing a button on the remote. I find some some interesting quotes on the web. message to the television. And and and and well basic operations like on and off, and switching channels, and and maybe teletext or something like that. well these are two remotes, and that's our our dilemma I think. But shall we make a basic remote control, just swapping channels and volume and power button and well nothing much more. Or more functions on the remote. maybe more devices you can influence. a radio or a v a video recorder, V_C_R_. any ideas about that? Basic or multifunctional? We'll got back on that later. So I didn't know what what way we would go.
And I just have one more idea. But, to have a trendy remote control, we can also make something like the Nokia mobile phones. To change covers. So if you have a trendy half with all red, yellow and something. And then you can put a red cover on it. Will this will this add to the cost? then it won't be will have just one cover on the original one. And then you can buy the covers. but you have to m be able to change it. D does it make it more difficult to design? I think it will be a little more difficult, but not too much. Just like with the Nokia mobile phones. Yeah but there are much more Nokia telephones than these ones. If it won't works then we'll get something else. Then we won't g go further with it. Yeah but are their profits bigger than their cost? a p a a cover made in in China, it it won't be I guess so expensive I think. Yeah but there are also design cost. Would you change the cover? I wi I won't. But maybe I think trendy people or like children where you can paint on it, I think that too less people would change it for good profit. So I'm not sure if it will make profit enough to But it's yeah it's original idea. but I don't think we have to do it.
So first I wanna ask the Industrial Designer to tell what he did. So It's a little difficult what I'm gonna tell you. It's about the working of the remote control. I just had an half an hour j to study it and I don't get it. First I will tell you something about the findings, what I discovered about the remote control. then I'll have some kind of map, and it's the top of the remote control. The remote control is a very difficult thing to to explain to just all of you wh who haven't seen a remote control inside. there's a lot of plastic on it, because its not so expensive. And there are a lot of wires, which connect the components in it, and there are switches and things like that. There's a lot of small electronics. So it won't be too expensive to build it. Only twelve Euro fifty I think we will make it. And here I have the top of the remote control. here's some kind of chip. on top of this, there are the numbers. you have all on your remote control. And the teletext button. And here's the battery. And when you push the button, it will will be sent to the chip. And the chip will send it to all kind of sub-components. My preferences? We shouldn't make it too big. also for the cost, we should only put one battery on it. A long-lasting battery. also for the cost, use only plastic. Also because of the cost, not too much buttons on it. We can also make a button with a menu button. And then that that you will see it on the T_V_. And the bleep signal, y you told us. but we can also use it a bleep like something, when the battery's empty, then there is a bleep. And also the bleep, when what I told you about when you lost it, and you push a button, and then you hear bleep bleep, and we will find it. The battery. You say one battery is cheaper. If
So welcome back. first. I want to say I'm the secretary, so I make the minutes. You find them in your in the map in the From the group. There's the minutes from the first meeting. You'll find the next minutes also there.
the well I think separate channels. So So so zero to nine or something. volume. To move up, move down. yes Do we make a menu? I think it will be q quite easy to use, to have four arrows. Up-down for channel selection, and left-right for volume. And if you press the menu button you get into the menu, Mute.
And we don't yet have to decide what the remote control would look like? Or that's for the next phase. I think that's enough for the next phase. Phase two is the conceptual design.
Your individual action, you can find them in the email.
Now we have to decide what controls do we need. Yeah maybe we can first have a discussion on the the product requirements you just said. Well a power button? the well I think separate channels. So So so zero to nine or something. volume. To move up, move down. Do we make a menu? yes I think it will be q quite easy to use, to have four arrows. Up-down for channel selection, and left-right for volume. And if you press the menu button you get into the menu, On the L_C_D_ screen, you mean? well yeah that depends on if you have the menu on the T_V_. Or you get the menu on the L_C_D_ screen on the remote control. Think it's better to have it on the remote control, But then we come to the costs. But well if you aim at the younger market, a as they as s as we seen in the usability lab, they will buy a nice looking remote control. So if we have a L_C_D_ sh screen, and not too many buttons, I think that will incre even when it's a bit more cost, it will still sell. Is this enough? Mute.
Now we have a few new product requirements. First, teletext. We have internet now so we don't need the teletext anymore. So not necessary. Only for the television. So we don't look at the other things like the radio or something. We look at the age group of forty plus. no, younger than forty. Our corporate colour and slogan must be used. So you can see it on our site. I personally think teletext is a good option. It's a new requirement. Yeah but we don't use it. No discussion about it.
And you can and you can make the the power button as a trigger. It's not good to use.
but like we said before, it has to be used on every television. but l when you see a menu on the television, it's like you see one to twenty, you go s scroll up, and push number tw twenty. Yeah, I think the younger people will have newer televisions, which can provide our remote control. But if we don't have a L_C_D_ we don't have a menu., then we have it on the T_V_, the menu. Yeah, but again maybe th How do we know the T_V_ can handle it?
Personally, I think two scroll buttons aren't easy to handle., then you can also have like th Yeah, and joystick, I think. Or a small one just like in a laptop. Does that break, a joystick? But how expensive it is? For the young peoples I think scroll button's good. That's not expensive than Joystick is better. Maybe, if it's possible, it's not too expensive, I think a joystick is better.
Now we put rubber around it. Hard plastic, the shape, and around it hard around it rubber.
Then for the components, we use a normal battery. Then it's Ch cheapest way, I think.
Maybe you can look how how much it is for the L_C_D_., can you give an indication in b in the cost difference between the chip with L_C_D_ or without? I got it on my screen and it was higher. But I don't know how much higher. The display requires a advanced chip, which is which in turn is more expensive than the regular chip. So, depends on the cost.
But the L_C_D_ is easy when you use the scroll buttons. And I think we must look further to to devel d develop something news. I think if we have an L_C_D_, it will also sell a lot better. And that might bring back the costs And if we put an L_C_D_ thing on it, then the costs will be much higher.
the push-buttons. We have one new thing discovered. It's a scroll push thing like a mouse. Maybe it's easy to use for the channels. When you want to go m move up, you just scroll up and click on the button, if you wanna see the next, if you wanna see that channel. You can do it with your thumb. And with your l left hand you can push the buttons The electrics with a scroll push button, we must use regular chips. There are also simple chips. They are cheaper., but then we have just a basic remote control, And you have also advanced chips. But that's with the L_C_D_ screen. And I think our budget is too low to use and an L_C_D_, Note that the push-button requires a simple chip chip. A scroll wheel requires minimally a regular chip, which is a higher price range. The display requires a advanced chip, which is which in turn is more expensive than the regular chip.
This is with an L_C_D_? No, But then it's not easy to use scroll wheel. And I think we must look further to to devel d develop something news. but then we'll get to the regular remote controls. And I think, what I said, everybody has them has them already. I got it on my screen and it was higher. And that might bring back the costs I think we must discuss who what will be better. If we have a better shape of the remote control, or better options on it. With a scroll menu, a w scroll thing, and a L_C_D_. And then a flat remote control. Or, a more hand-shaped remote control, with scroll, without L_C_D_. Maybe you can look how how much it is for the L_C_D_. Not with an L_C_D_. But the L_C_D_ is easy when you use the scroll buttons. but l when you see a menu on the television, it's like you see one to twenty, you go s scroll up, and push number tw twenty. but like we said before, it has to be used on every television. Yeah, I think the younger people will have newer televisions, which can provide our remote control., can you give an indication in b in the cost difference between the chip with L_C_D_ or without? But I don't know how much higher. I think if we have an L_C_D_, it will also sell a lot better. The display requires a advanced chip, which is which in turn is more expensive than the regular chip.
So, my presentation is about trend-watching., well we made an investigation of the market, by Trendwatchers. They watch in cities like Paris and Milan., we have two groups, young and trendy, and the old and rich. Well th and the young and trendy, they they starting to like fruit and vegetables as a theme for n clothes, shoes, and also products. And, material? That should feel have a spongy feeling. Then the old and rich. They like dark colours, and simple, recognisable shapes. We aim at the younger market. Well, then already come to my personal preferences. However, with trends it's always if there's it's now. It it it might last one year, and next year it be can be totally different.
Well, we have to decide on the concept. Maybe one of you can paint it on the board. Can make several concepts. We have this, and we had the idea of an a more like sh in the shape of your hand. This is the remote control. And then you have something like th this under it. So, it has to be soft? And it has to be soft, yeah. Buttons on top of it. The scrolling. You can do it with your thumb. But now we use one scroll button and the other one is here. If we have a menu, how do we choose other options? with the menu button. And then you also can scroll scroll in it. But if we don't have a L_C_D_ we don't have a menu., then we have it on the T_V_, the menu. Yeah, but again maybe th How do we know the T_V_ can handle it? And if we put an L_C_D_ thing on it, then the costs will be much higher. we make two concepts. One with L_C_D_. One without L_C_D_. And and this one has to be soft. And this has to be harder, And you can and you can make the the power button as a trigger. It's not good to use. Or some kind of rubber around it. One with two scroll buttons and one with without., one with a with a menu, and one without a menu. And the one with with a menu has an L_C_D_. Yes, but you don't know which of the scroll buttons you have to choose. Then it depends on the cost. M yeah, maybe it's better if the scroll-wheels are more separate, yeah. Like, you have the menu button in between I also think this concept is not what the young people were looking for. When you the menu, you have to go there there there there. We have two buttons missing. The mute button. Mute. And the other. Personally, I think two scroll buttons aren't easy to handle. With the switch button. But how do you wanna solve it
let's talk about the interface concept., first I'll I'll discuss the buttons we just chose, show you some samples, discuss some colours and design maybe, already. And my personal preferences. Well we chose the power button to switch the television on and off. the mute button to switch the volume on and o on and off. The channels buttons, one to nine, zero to nine, and the button to choose higher channels than nine. the volume and channel quadrants, left and right, up and down arrows, to do the volume and channel. And the menu menu button to man manipulate the L_C_D_ display., I found some interesting samples. Examples., well what's pretty standard is that it's that they're all pretty high Large. A lot a lot of buttons buttons. Large and and and pretty thin and and long., power buttons are mostly at the top left or right. Yeah, well arrow b buttons can be blue. And what's interesting is the the the icons on the buttons. Some buttons have icons like the play and stop, but we don't use that. But, these we we have to choose the right icons, or or letters. this is the V_ for volume, but they're both a V_. So it's it's not really very clear what's the function of that. For the menu, what do we use for that? We don't have buttons for the menu. Or we may have to use channel of the volume and channel. I thought that was our idea. And that the menu button is okay. Yeah but, has to be clear that you can use the arrows. The icons on the arrows, as well, you mean.
, well I don't I don't know if we have to discuss this already, or in the next meeting. But, as we have to to to design the the case and the whole remote control in our our our corporate company colours and the logo, I would recommend a yellow case., round edges. The logo at the bottom. And, well maybe each each set of buttons has has his own colour., recognisable. Not too much colours., no. Not too much. But this has to be has to be trendy, yeah so good good icons on the buttons, and and big buttons is my personal opinion.
, at first we will I will f say something about what younger people want, our group w w we want to sell our remote controls to. And then, I'll discuss what my opinion is about the costs, about what battery is in it, what kind of buttons also. First, the younger people, they want like soft mat materials and primary colours. Like, totally yellow, totally red., the shapes are curved and round, Maybe it's nice to get a remote control not like all the other ones, straight and flat and long. But to give him the shape of your hand, so you it's easier to use or something like that. The battery, there are few options., I think the best option is to use the basic battery., the the form of the remote control, I think it's also nice have it curved. And maybe like it's hand-shaped. material, you use plastic. Hard plastic And also rubber And maybe it's also then thoughtful if we u use as different kind of shapes for the for remote control, that we then use the primary colours.
You two stay here. It has to be ready in the next meeting.
, I think the best option is to use the basic battery. Chip. Depends on the L_C_D_. If we use a scroll, then we have the regular chip. If we don't use a scroll, then we can use the simple chip. And, we If you use the L_C_D_, we have to the most expensive. So, the shapes of the design depends on the L_C_D_ Or shall we just put it on the pistol thing? If you have pistol, it L_C_D_'s not easy. if you have like an a ni a Playstation game controller. Then this is the design. And the buttons are on the next page. So, depends on the cost. And on the L_C_D_, how much it costs? they're not in details. It's more expensive or less expensive,? So, after this meeting you have half an hour to fix it.
Maybe you can look how how much it is for the L_C_D_.
well when we lose one scroll-wheel, it's okay. 'Cause we can't lose the battery. We can't lose the advanced chip. We can't lose the double curve. We have rubber, special colour., I don't think it's a very special colour. Yellow?, is it a special colour? For a remote control, I think it is. If we would have normal buttons instead of the joystick. For up down left right., then we lose two Euros. Then we have thirteen Euros. Half a Euro too much. Exactly the special colours. just only plastic or only rubber? One Euro discount. I think we have to keep the L_C_D_. And if you say it's just a r normal colour Normal colour, and the the joystick away, Then you'll have to m see the menu on the television. If we lose the L_C_D_, then we have an regular chip and no L_C_D_. And then we move the the colour. No joystick. Push-buttons. No special colour. So, all the buttons has to have to be the same colour. And you cannot use the red and green button.
But if you lose the joystick, it's still an advanced chip? Or it's then a regular? The advanced chip was for the L_C_D_ If we lose the L_C_D_, then we have an regular chip and no L_C_D_.
Now, the finance. Do we change the the order? Or are we going to ev evaluate it first? Finance is first Yes. We have to evaluate the product yet. Sorry.
It's too expensive. Fifteen Euros. So, we have to change something.
Now, project eva evaluation. process. Went good. I think the creativity was good enough. leadership. Yeah, you were the project project manager, and had the final vote. Team-work okay. New ideas found. Nope. I I espe I especially liked the the means, the the SMARTboard Yeah, I think you have to compare it to if you would have a normal normal project without laptops and without these devices. Well, the laptops if you have them out front of you, you sometimes looking at that instead of the presentation., well the draw-board, well you can draw things. But it not really going very convenient., maybe it will be easier if you have a smaller monitor, and the project. Yeah, I agree on what was said mainly., yeah but you always have that some people are talking more than others. And maybe is then the task of the the project manager to also ask more to the people less talking. I think it was good. Not too many discussions. So, it's good for the speed. So, I think we're ready. Good price. Evaluation ready.
well when we lose one scroll-wheel, it's okay. 'Cause we can't lose the battery. We can't lose the advanced chip. We can't lose the double curve. We have rubber, special colour., I don't think it's a very special colour. Yellow?, is it a special colour? For a remote control, I think it is. If we would have normal buttons instead of the joystick. For up down left right., then we lose two Euros. Then we have thirteen Euros. Half a Euro too much. Exactly the special colours. just only plastic or only rubber? One Euro discount. I think we have to keep the L_C_D_. And if you say it's just a r normal colour Normal colour, and the the joystick away, But if you lose the joystick, it's still an advanced chip? Or it's then a regular? The advanced chip was for the L_C_D_ If we lose the L_C_D_, then we have an regular chip and no L_C_D_. Then you'll have to m see the menu on the television. And then we move the the colour. No joystick. Push-buttons. No special colour. And you cannot use the red and green button. So, all the buttons has to have to be the same colour. What's the normal colour? Very good.
Next. Finance. So, now we have a product. But, is it cheap enough? We have a battery. Cheapest there is. Electronics. Advanced chip. it's the most advanced. We have the simple, regular and advanced. We have the adva advanced. We have double curved. we have half rubber, half plastic. Special colour. Yes, yellow. So, we have the L_C_D_ We have two scroll-wheels? Or one? One. And it's not really a s Joystick thing. Now, button supplement. Special colour. The buttons are regular colour. It's too expensive. Fifteen Euros. So, we have to change something.
Two. So, come back to the presentation now. So, we find yourself there, and now we have to calculate an average rating. Effort is three, ten and twelve. Thirty, forty, fifty,. Twenty one. So, it's two and three nine two and one third. So, that's a pretty low rating, I think. So, it's good. So, according to our own evaluation we did a good job.
, we gonna do the evaluation now, together. I have thinked a few evaluation criterias, based on our marketing strategy, on the latest trends, on user preferences., we have a seven point scale from true, as well. To false, seven? And on base of each c criteria, we need to give a rating., well we have the Word document, what this just an example. So, this not very important. But, if I can get a number in here., so you have to think of it as the remote control is techno technologically innovative., and then we have to agree on the rating together. And in the end, we will c count an average of all rating. Yeah, I think it's, well technologically using, it's not it doesn't contain many new features., I think I will give it a yeah, yeah, yeah, a four. I think the scroll-button is something also new. I think technologically I'll give it an seven. So now i I think you see it its statement. And you true or false. Oh, true or false. Oh, I'll I'll give it a t a two. Two. It's a one. The first item., this product is for all sorts of customers. Well, it's a statement which I disagree with, because we really aim at at young market and I think the way it looked c totally in yellow, it's not really aimed for all customers. That's a six., four. So I think it's four. I mean it still has l large buttons and not m many buttons. Maybe version three point O_ has other colours. We put the fashion in electronics. Yeah, well do we do this with this product? I think if we do this, as it's c it's really orientates on the design., so I would give it a two. Me too a two, because only the battery is not techin technologically high standard., I say a five. It's not fashion, it's new. Then make it th three. The next element is the product looks good. Well personally, I do not prefer a remote control that's fully in
Now, I ask you to presentate the prototype. This is it. It's it's it's yellow. And, this is rubber. And and and this too. And the rest is hard plastic. the sides. We had a new idea that that this can can be turned inside. And then it covers the these buttons And then you can still use the the power button and the mute and the the joystick. So, you can still operate all the things. Because you don't always use the menu. And the buttons? Big buttons. And everything is blue, except the power button. yeah, and the mute and the the other button. And the joystick is for the volume and the channels. Very obvious. Up is channel up. Down is channel down. To the right is volume up. To the left is volume down. Okay, so if joystick and L_C_D_. What's the R_R_ R_R_'s the l the the the the company logo. That's on the rub rubber part. So, what they say on the side is put fashion there. So, that's it. That's prototype.
If we would have normal buttons instead of the joystick. For up down left right. Normal colour, and the the joystick away, No joystick. Push-buttons. No special colour.
, I don't think it's a very special colour. And if you say it's just a r normal colour Normal colour, and the the joystick away, And then we move the the colour. No joystick. Push-buttons. No special colour.
I think we have to keep the L_C_D_.
process. Went good. I think the creativity was good enough. leadership. Yeah, you were the project project manager, and had the final vote. Team-work okay. New ideas found. Nope. I I espe I especially liked the the means, the the SMARTboard Yeah, I think you have to compare it to if you would have a normal normal project without laptops and without these devices. Well, the laptops if you have them out front of you, you sometimes looking at that instead of the presentation., well the draw-board, well you can draw things. But it not really going very convenient., maybe it will be easier if you have a smaller monitor, and the project. Yeah, I agree on what was said mainly., yeah but you always have that some people are talking more than others. And maybe is then the task of the the project manager to also ask more to the people less talking. I think it was good. Not too many discussions. So, it's good for the speed.
or your personal coach will probably email you about th it.
and first of all it should be original, it should be trendy and user-friendly. it's a remote control, this new product we are are g are going to develop,
the remote control we are going to develop will have a selling price of about twenty five Euros. the profit we are looking for for this product is fifty million Euros,
we we will focus this internationally,
Yes, but there's a cost limitation too. So that's a big problem, I think. I think the the financial part of this project implicates that it's not going to be a high high-end product. The cost price is very low.
maybe we could for example only light the buttons that are applicable at that moment or But then Bluetooth might be problem. It's use a lot of Well does it? I know it from the cell phone. Well, cell phones have integrated Bluetooth also and, well, it's it seems to work quite okay. But you can't you can't use Bluetooth all the time, twenty four hours a day.
Okay. Gentlemen, I'm afraid we do not have any more time. so we will go back to our own work. next meeting starts in thirty minutes and, well, you know your o your individual actions or your personal coach will probably email you about th it. See you in thirty minutes.
so we will go back to our own work. and, well, you know your o your individual actions
And you you see the buttons as a as a means of doing this? Or are there any o other controls? Yeah, or maybe you want a touch-screen or I I've seen these remote controls with this little stick which you can move forward, sidewords. And it's very easy for a user to to switch to to switch b between channels or change between tracks on a on a C_D_, And for other user interface I had, well, it's more industrial thing. point at a T_V_, I think it's it's quite disturbing when you always have to point directly to the T_V_, so in that case infrared should maybe be restriction to that. so you must point everywhere, Maybe not even pointed. So when you're not able to point at the device the range is very limited. For T_V_, you're always in in the neighbourhood of a T_V_, so I don't think think the range should be a problem to that, but if you want to get it working with a radio, and you're in outside your garden with just one speaker, then maybe the range should be You should able to feel the buttons without it mis you have to know what you do without looking at the buttons, so it should be as user interface for feeling should be good to understand. And of course you don't always know where all buttons are, so it should be visible al in dark too. I'll write down glow in the dark. But lots of devices already use infrared. And, yeah, infrared might be an issue. we'll probably have to implement that. you said something about visibility in the dark. would it be nice for a user to have display on this remote control, on which you can see functions? but it it can be quite simple, you can just have white buttons with a black mark on it. The the the digits in black. then it's already visible in dark. So it it don't have to be a lightning or or a fancy well, it can be for design, of course
because because we wa we want to develop a trendy product. Yes, but there's a cost limitation too. So that's a big problem, I think. twelve Euro fifty, yeah. I think the the financial part of this project implicates that it's not going to be a high high-end product. The cost price is very low.
d I think the device should either be rechargeable very easily or it should not consume too much power. Because it's very annoying if you need to change the batteries every s every other week. maybe we could for example only light the buttons that are applicable at that moment or But then Bluetooth might be problem. It's use a lot of Well does it? I know it from the cell phone. Well, cell phones have integrated Bluetooth also and, well, it's it seems to work quite okay. But you can't you can't use Bluetooth all the time, twenty four hours a day.
the remote control we are going to develop will have a selling price of about twenty five Euros. the profit we are looking for for this product is fifty million Euros, we we will focus this internationally, And the production costs should not be more than twelve Euro fifty,
And the production costs should not be more than twelve Euro fifty,
maybe the time for Sebastian to show his presentation. Yes, I have some technical issues which I would like to present to you before we start the discussion, I would like to think about the implementation of of things, and the technical possibilities and impossibilities. So if someone of you comes up with ideas, I'll try to translate them in technical functions, but there might be some impossibilities. and I also will remind people of some new technical possibilities which are available I have some initial ideas about some things One thing about interopera operability. I think a modern remote control should control a device diverse subset of equipment. for instance, D_V_D_ players, cell phones, video and audio equipment. Well, there should be some interoperabi interoperability between them. and we should think about the way how these things should communicate with each other. We're not living in the nineteen eighties anymore, so infrared is not is not really hot technical stuff anymore. But you should think about the things like Bluetooth. Yeah, but the infrared, it's, well, a little bit old-fashioned, if you would call it like that. But all the T_V_s are equipped with infrared, so you should equip infrared and Bluetooth together in one remote. but that's something we should discuss but take these things into account when you start the discussion.
the remote should work on different T_V_s or even different devices?
I I do think it's time now to to discuss some things. Sebastian told us a few things about the technical implemen implications. there are other things like how to make it trendy, which is I think most Ru Ruud's role. the way how it should be controlled by the user, which is Roo r during this part. H how do you think the remote should function for the user? Okay, I just want to hear Ruud's input for this meeting. do you have anything already w ab idea about how the market will respond to the such a product? Or what we should take in account when developing such a product? I think most most things have already been said, And, yeah, infrared might be an issue. like control multiple devices.
Yes, I think it should be something like that. I think it's a universal remote control for customers to buy just new in a store. we're just developing this product, and we want to sell it to a very broad public,
well, the interoperability, just like Sebastian said, the remote should work on different T_V_s or even different devices?
I think it's a universal remote control for customers to buy just new in a store. Yes, I think it should be something like that. It's not for for for Philips or whatever to buy our remote for their own product, right? Okay, so we're we're going business to consumer, Yeah, I do I don't know that. We're not developing this product for a specific vendor, are we? don't have the information for it.
Okay, the waiting is for our Marketing Expert, Ruud. Is there a schedule for this meeting? Yes, there is actually. I will li list the agenda for today. For this meeting. It's important that the laptops are exactly on the square, for the cameras. we're here to develop a new product. this is the first meeting to to generate some some ideas about it. you are here in a specific role. Ruud is here as the Marketing Expert, Roo is here as the User Interface Designer and Sebastian is here in the role of Industrial Designer. we're going to do a little tool training for the tools we are going to use during the meetings we are going to have here. then I will tell you a little bit about my idea of the project plan, and we will have a discussion. this meeting should take no more than twenty five minutes, is there any room for a little presentation? maybe during the discussion section? No problem. this new product we are are g are going to develop, it's a remote control, and first of all it should be original, it should be trendy and user-friendly. we will discuss later on more ideas about how the remote should look and how it sh it should function and all those kind of things. we are going to use a a pred a project method during this development, the functional design, the conceptual design and the detailed design, all of these stages mean that we do some individual work, prepare, and then meet to discuss our the the first stage, the functional design we are going to search for the user requirements, the second is the technical functional design, what effect should the remote have? and the last one is the working design. How exactly does it work in the technical sense.
Okay, before we think about remote control we will work with some of the tools we have here. You can display pr two presentations if you want to. to presentate, to show us a file you'll need to place it in your project documents folder, then we have this electronic white-board system. you can draw on the board using this pen. There are little sensors, it's on the eraser now, so we click the pen button. you can insert a new slide or or white-board file by either using the insert function or by clicking the next button or the blank button. all our whi SMARTboard notes should be kept in the same file. So do not m make a new file. But we all use the same white-board file so now I d have a different line width and colour. Current colour, you can choose another colour. I wrote down the documents should be in the project documents folder as a little training I will ask Ruud first to draw your own animal on a new slide with a different colour and a different line width than the one now selected. a wee rabbit. Roo, could you do the same please? But a different animal with a different colour and a different line width. It it should be a cat. Okay, so you can use this at any time during the presentation if you want to.
And do we even prefer the sound above the the LEDs, the lightning function? I I think so,
So we might want to build in a feature to support them. Some audio signal. Like home phones. m maybe w we we do agree on on the thing that the remote should have such a function, if it's possible within the costs and all that kind of things. Yeah.
I think it's the same as in the cell phone, just light in in the device that that shines on all the buttons,
And the money we save on using this we can use for elaborate fancy lighting techniques, blinking LEDs and all that kind of fancy stuff. It should be an easy interface with not so much buttons. S just a a p a p a volume and a programme one. And yeah, some some fancy lights.
So we might want to build in a feature to support them. Some audio signal. Like home phones. I don't think people would bother walking to the T_V_ and press that button because they lost the their remote. There's no elaborate technique used in this kind of equipment.
they're p f power friendly LEDs also. no, they're they're a little bit more expensive,
if we use the LEDs, i does it use much more energy
And if we if we could inc include a c a cradle in which it could recharge, then there wouldn't be a big problem.
but I want the kind of functions, for example th the most important are volume and programme selecting. when you add speech recognition to your remote control, it's very easy to change the channel. That's one thing. but keep the programme and the volume, It should be an easy interface with not so much buttons. S just a a p a p a volume and a programme one. And yeah, some some fancy lights.
Dual channel watch.
It's just an easy way of of a round button what which can be pushed in four directions. Instead of a stick. just a round button should be the trick, I think.
do you think the market would would respond to a simple if we include other innovative functions then they might, 'cause young people like new features.
The buttons to zap are used the about fifteen hundred times, And lots of people complained they kin can't find their remote control.
And the m most easy way to do this is by sending pulses of infrared light to a T_V_ set. The user interface connected to a chip, which is connected to the sender, which generates messages using infrared light,
But my in my opinion, the the easy to use R_C_ is the best possi possibility for us.
But before I do that I w I want to warn you that by implementing this kind of a function the technical design will become more complicated
And the money we save on using this we can use for elaborate fancy lighting techniques, blinking LEDs and all that kind of fancy stuff. It should be an easy interface with not so much buttons. S just a a p a p a volume and a programme one. And yeah, some some fancy lights.
But we can have just a home stat f a base station next to the T_V_. Just a little antenna or something. just a base station next to the T_V_ is the best possibility. But that will be very costly, I think.
personally I think we should infra use infrared, another important point is we really should use energy sparse, friendly components. for cost-effectiveness, we should really use a very low-cost circuit board,
maybe maybe like clapping in your hands, Because how can you separate the clapping sound from other sounds.
the third requirement is that we should focus on customers that are younger than forty,
the new project requirements, but we should not support teletext in the remote, the remote control should only be used for television, then for Roo, as well important, the corporate image should be recognisable in our product.
I'm sure the marketing expert will receive t you will do some trend watching.
User Interface Designer, Roo, I would like to see the user interface c concept.
the Interface Designer, I would like to the next meeting I would like to receive the components concept.
although we are focussing on younger people to make it profitable Profitable. We we yeah, we still need to take in account the the bit older people.
I will put the minutes I just made in the project documents folder.
maybe Sebastian should have a detailed look later on and come up with a solution,
but I'm afraid it will be a bit costly.
but I want the kind of functions, for example th the most important are volume and programme selecting. Dual channel watch. when you add speech recognition to your remote control, it's very easy to change the channel. That's one thing. but keep the programme and the volume, we've decided to implement a seemingly easy design.
maybe it can be combined with the find the remote control. when you add speech recognition to your remote control, it's very easy to change the channel. That's one thing.
You c you can d make them very fancy
And and do we want the ten digits? I wouldn't buy it personally. A remote control without the ten digits. But I think these ten buttons look a bit dull. If if we would drop the ten digits
So if you want the spongy feel, you need to make these buttons all all of rubber.
What about the finishing of the case? Yeah, with colourful rubber. because they're they're rubber too. we should have it the other way around, I guess. A plastic cover with rubber finishing. What about making this rubber and making this plastic? I'm I'm not so sure,
it should be a full colour cover with such an image but I'm afraid it's not possible to print a picture on the device.
Yeah, although I don't think that's very colourful. Except for the yellow of course,
But but do we want the curved design, So I think this is the best of two worlds. I suggest we use the the sensor sample. the sample sensor and sample speaker. with a with a regular chip. And and the scroll scroll-wheels. you talked about it before, the colours, grey and yellow. The casing is curved, single-curved. and I think we should use the company colours. Something like black and red. black and yellow. The scroll-heel. Yes, the voice recognition we already decided.
I guess you two have to figure that out.
then the corporate identity should be in the product. I guess that is something for Roo and Sebastian.
and the I_D_ and the U_I_D_ need to work together on the prototype drawing on the SMARTboard.
we even seem to have hand dyn dynamos for powering our remote controls. there's there's also a kinetic energy supply. And we of course have the traditional solar power,
of course we have the push-buttons and we also have scroll-wheels. in the indicators we have the L_C_D_ displays, this is my volume button. And I can either on this side or this side And click it to muten the device.
And and the scroll scroll-wheels. The scroll-heel. Yes,
You could make a few v very colourful ones, and a very traditional co cover. or like cell phones, exch exchangeable covers.
We have the uncurved or flat case. that's the most common remote con control form We have a curved one. which is curved in three dimension.
We can use plastic, We can use wood and titanium. which is the same for rubber,
And for you, the product evaluation.
And there is something like a sample sensor and sample speaker,
So it it needs to be rubber. But but do we want the curved design, So I think this is the best of two worlds. The casing is curved, single-curved. Yeah, with colourful rubber.
Traditional batteries and solar.
And some fashion watchers have found out that the young target group likes fruit and vegetables in their clothes, shoes and furniture, and that they want spongy material. or like cell phones, exch exchangeable covers. You could make a few v very colourful ones, and a very traditional co cover.
maybe it rubber And what I'm thinking about, maybe we should make very light but a grip
Ease of use is important, but innovation is more important, and a fancy look and feel is even more important.
Traditional batteries and solar.
d did we already decide on the display? No. I don't think you need it. And skip and skip the L_C_D_ part.
according to Ruud, the the the market likes new flashy technology, I think our customers will go insane.
what about the issue I addressed at the beginning of the meeting? the voice function w with the infrared issue. It's it's I I can imagine it's very dull to talk to a device w if you have to point to another device.
I can't see any scenario where you would use a scroll-wheel with a button on it. There's no scenario where you use the button in the scroll-wheel.
But if you're watching a movie, how many times you take the the remote control and and But the problem here is that it it supplies a a very little amount of kinetic energy.
M m but maybe you do want a programme button to for example activate the voice recognition, or train the voice voice recognition. okay. Okay, yeah, that's right. Or something li like that.
But w we weren't aware of the prices of the costs.
The production costs. Twenty two. th this design is not within our price model.
we need to redesign the product.
And what makes it very expensive is for example the solar cell. by not using the voice recognition feature,
but I agree it's it's not a fancy high-tech device. Definitely not, no.
Is it? Is it fancy? just give it a two. was it innovative? I think it's a two. Is it easy to use? so it will be a two point five. Is it easy to find? but I personally give it a one. The feel of the remote control is spongy. and make this a one point five. The remote control offers enough features. I'll give it a one. For for the for this t type of market, I think it's a one.
by giving it another colour already. Although I think we yeah, but we could still make a remote control that ap applies more to young people
we'll go further on with the the rest of the evaluation. About the project itself, not about the product. looking at room for creativity, there was w way too the the choice of components was way too narrow. leadership. Fantastic. I think we're a good team. I missed it to be able to contact you in between and say, hey Roo. the means, the SMARTboard, the digital pen. Did you like 'em?. The digital pen was okay, but SMARTboard was really bad. The drawing cap capabilities are very limited.
we are evaluating this this design now. This prototype.
maybe not not all that fancy, but just way way more easy basic but that's not what has been asked.
A a and the voice recognition as well, it's it's it's another approach,
but you c you can you can just say find and he repeats find.
And and the case is is rubber? And the buttons? Plastic or rubber. yellow with grey or black or something like that. Whatever cost cost the least.
The production costs. Twenty two.
It becomes a very dull remote control, I know. I think we we we all know what the redesign should be. A simple, dull, one-coloured box.
The production costs. Twenty two. th this design is not within our price model.
then I did the following changes. Twelve Euro forty cents I came up with by leaving out the solar cells,
by not using the voice recognition feature,
First step will be the functional design. Anyway, we'll take this project in three steps, three pha three phase of design.
so to help with these, you have we have the SMARTboards here. I'm supposed to give you an introduction on this doodling board, just stuff that you wanna share, just put it in the in the project folder,
we need design a remote control for television set, which has to be original, trendy and user-friendly. The project I got was just for a T_V_ remote control.
I'll be your Project Manager for today, for this project. I will be Pr Project the Marketing Expert. User Interface Designer. I'm the Industrial Designer,
What are y What are your first ideas for the new product? Do we want people who are disabled in any way to, yeah, to be able to use it as well? but I think it's a little take it into consideration. is the the material it is made of, it should be something light.
is the the material it is made of, it should be something light.
No rational changes or whatever, 'cause it revolutionary changes, so very intuitive design, I guess.
Selling price, twenty five Euros. The production price, twelve and a half Euros, approximately.
gonna give the electronic white-board a shot. So, draw us your favourite animal. It's supposed to be a dolphin, I like the elephant. the animal I'd like to draw is a tiger. I introduce to the world the amazing ant.
Do we want people who are disabled in any way to, yeah, to be able to use it as well? but I think it's a little take it into consideration.
we need design a remote control for television set, The project I got was just for a T_V_ remote control.
And another thing they want was speech recognition And they want maybe an L_C_D_ screen they want to pay for an L_C_D_ screen and speech recognition.
also symbols tend to fade after a while.
just keep in mind that the important buttons should be on top and either big,
that was in the test, the the most people f find it irritating when they cannot find a rem their remote control,
then I'd I'd like to know now if we want the universal remote control or not,
so I think it's a bee beep to sound it and you can find it. So we agree on the the part that we need to get something on the on the remote to find it somewhere
but you can't you cannot take into consideration all the different brands of T_V_s. Because it needs to be configured in the television under the menu. If it isn't, then we cannot reach it. But I think most modern T_V_s have it in their menu. isn't there a possibility to do research on that, so we know that for sure?
There are many buttons on a remote control which are not clear.
Is it techni technically possible to send a signal to a television and then pops up a menu, I don't think so.
Shall we also look if it's possible to make a rechargeable remote? to have like sort of a maybe a base station that you put on the T_V_. Could be flat, you could insert your remote into it.
you should you should look into the in into the materials that are real durable.
Think it's like this. and since you're holding it like this, I suggest you put the channel up channel down and volume I think that the the buttons should be the channel buttons should be on their own. maybe the menu button can go i in the middle. Yeah, in the middle. the power button somewhere over here? I think it should be at the bottom somewhere. Mute. Around not not at top at the around the volume selection. Where would we want the teletext button? Do we put it somewhere over here? Do we put the volume control and the channel control here, In the middle. Maybe in a circle for example, like we like in this example. but we do agree that we keep this at the centre, I think the channel button should be in the centre.
but just take a look at it,
The switch if you p press it then some electrical charge goes into the processor, that thinks over a Morse code, then the signal is sent to two light bulbs. You have infrared
you have to come up with a components concept,
And they want maybe an L_C_D_ screen they want to pay for an L_C_D_ screen and speech recognition. Oh, we're not going to be able to sell it for twenty-five then, with an L_C_D_ screen.
Like you said teletext is not not very popular anymore This is a new product and with this new product we want to appeal to younger people, the younger people were defined under forty. And one thing that should be important is that the corporate l colour and slogan are recognisable,
I'll put some on paper draw us up some some designs of of possible
we could do some i do some work now on on the design for example. I think that the the buttons should be the channel buttons should be on their own. and since you're holding it like this, I suggest you put the channel up channel down and volume Think it's like this. maybe the menu button can go i in the middle. Yeah, in the middle. the power button somewhere over here? I think it should be at the bottom somewhere. Mute. Around not not at top at the around the volume selection. Where would we want the teletext button? Do we put it somewhere over here? Do we put the volume control and the channel control here, In the middle. Maybe in a circle for example, like we like in this example. but we do agree that we keep this at the centre, I think the channel button should be in the centre.
Shall we also look if it's possible to make a rechargeable remote? I'm not sure y I'm not sure it's if it's expensive, But I think that will cost a lot. I'm not sure if it costs a lot,
'Cause it sounds pretty expensive too. Speech recognition, I think it's very hard, Oh, we're not going to be able to sell it for twenty-five then, with an L_C_D_ screen.
they want to spend money for a better system, for better remote control,
just keep in mind that the important buttons should be on top and either big,
Maybe it's a little more curves or whatever. And with different colours. we should do a little thing about design, Different colours maybe. And the design, it should differ.
This is a new product and with this new product we want to appeal to younger people, the younger people were defined under forty.
And possibly also the size, so more important buttons, bigger you should you should look into the in into the materials that are real durable. just keep in mind that the important buttons should be on top and either big, we don't want we want very little buttons, just the buttons you use a lot.
And one thing that should be important is that the corporate l colour and slogan are recognisable,
I think the p yeah, the beep is a very simple thing to imple implement, just make a button on your T_V_ we should go for that. Perhaps we should also make something like a flash on it, if you if it's lost, for people that are deaf. We could make a combination that it goes beep and that you that some light lights up. We could do that.
so I think it's a bee beep to sound it and you can find it. this is basically what I h had in mind in the fade-proof symbols, locator, a sound, So we agree on the the part that we need to get something on the on the remote to find it somewhere
For example, if your buttons are faded, after I mean if you make a durable remote, they are faded, you can just buy a new cover.
I think it's universal. I think we should go for universal,
I have to check that out, Yeah, just look at the possibilities then, Just to do research into both, w what it costs and what it takes for space.
you should do some trend-watching, Could you post some other essentials of what people want,
If you're reading from top to bottom, I think it's better to put it at the top. I I'm not sure. So we have three people saying it should be on top.
let's give this a name, and not like some vague serial number that no one understands, like with cars. Yeah, let's think of a name, okay.
Prototype presentation, well first
Basically in what we discussed, cover and buttons will be made of rubber, yellow colour, black components, We chose a different type of colour for the menu. A bit darker yellow
We chose the buttons to be teletext, okay button, favourite channel and the mute.
I think it was too bad we didn't have the financial info the last time. There was just too little information about what things actually cost and if you could use them.
let's eval evaluate the product of us, our design. I will pre present some statements and we will decided together wha what if it's true or false
So so the buttons, the look and feel. One and a half. And the next one yeah, when it's lost you can find it. so I think it that's that deserves a one. Definitely. And the next one. Manual. A three. So I might make this a two instead of a one, I guess. You can use the L_C_D_ in a good way. I mean the shape is trendy. Maybe we should go with a two then, mostly it's it's influenced by the fact that we didn't have enough resources to implement speech recognition. 'Cause yeah, that gives you a seven,
You have pushbuttons and an L_C_D_ display. we have advanced chips and the sam the sensor. The sample sensor and for speak recognition anyway.
For example, I thou I thought we were pretty creative in what we created. I think we did pretty well as team-work though. Because, yeah was very hard to work with one another if you cannot communicate in the meantime, Although for actual design I'd say the response time should be a little bit higher, So we cannot work on more than one page at same time. That's not possible.
You have the total of seventeen Euros in production cost,
Triple R_ it is.
have to write my report now, I guess.
think I had the best solution that I came up with is just to s take out the speech recognition.
Could you guys draw me a picture of the final design to put on the cover of the report? Yeah, sure.
Because, yeah was very hard to work with one another if you cannot communicate in the meantime,
so I had to take out the special colour I suppose. and if you want it if you want the custom design, then you can buy the separate covers. I think the colour is more important than the really the curve, but the example is because we do offer the the possibility of adding your own custom covers. I think it's the best solution to make those cu custom covers for the design aspect
we could take out the curve. Can we then not also change the material? We take plastic for the basic cover I say lose the curve. Oh that's true,
So can't we just basically extend it to thirteen? the project is a no-go if we go over twelve and a half, so why why do we have to keep us on the twelve and a half? and we got our our orders from the pro from the boss of our company
What are we displaying on the L_C_D_ screen? Things like brightness and those kind of things we've put in the menu, I thought that people wanted previews on their I don't think it's possible really. with configuring your remote control for favourite your favourite channel for example, how do you configure that. So that could be done by L_C_D_ display. I do admit that we d did miss a little or didn't sp didn't talk talk enough about the possibility of the L_C_D_ display. like I said, changing channels, everything hidden in your L_C_D_ display, so you just need the navigation buttons to do everything.
I think a SMARTboard SMARTboard is pretty cool. Although for actual design I'd say the response time should be a little bit higher,
So we cannot work on more than one page at same time. That's not possible.
think I had the best solution that I came up with is just to s take out the speech recognition. You have the total of seventeen Euros in production cost,
I think it's the best solution to make those cu custom covers for the design aspect Yeah. I would say I would agree with you on the colour, we're final on that.
Triple R_ it is.
You have the total of seventeen Euros in production cost,
What do we scrap.
