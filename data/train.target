They go on to have discussion, with one member suggesting that they make the banana more stylized so that it looks less like a banana- for example, it could be silver.
They do not yet seem set about the idea of making it a banana shape, and one group member feels that the shape is not handy.
In addition, he talks about giving the control a double curve, curves on both the sides so that it is easy to hold and handle.
The marketing expert has to look up product evaluation.
Before the next meeting, the interface specialist and industrial designer have to work together on the user interface and the look/feel design.
The remote will have a base station, a button on the base station to press, 2 scroll wheels for the channels and volume, a turbo button (possibly underneath the device), and an on/off button for the TV.
Thus far, LCD and ASR have been ruled out.
The marketing expert is first to present, and he talks about making a pleasant-looking device, particularly one that favors current trends.
They then begin talking about using a fruit, vegetable, or natural object as the shape of the remote, the logo, or for the buttons.
Eventually they decide to make the device the shape of a banana.
Next, the user interface specialist presents.
He annouces that the technology division of their company has developed an integrated programmeable sample speaker unit, which would allow a person to have a conversation with the remote control.
They have the option of using that technology.
He also included a turbo button for speed, which he thinks every design should have.
He suggests putting two scroll wheels- one for changing the channel and another for the volume.
After that the interface specialist talks about having a base station for the purpose of finding the remote control when lost.
Since they can only charge twenty-five euro they decide to eliminate the LCD screen idea.
The group has not yet agreed on whether the remote should be banana-shaped.
The project manager opens the meeting, stating that it is about conceptual design.
He restates the last meeting's descision that they will not do speech recognition technology but says they still have to decide whether to use an LCD screen.
He shows them his plan what the remote control could look like and the features it might have.
Then they move on to the three presentations.
There is concern that the shape is not handy and might make the product less marketable- that would be a problem since they have to meet the fifty million euros profit goal.
Plastic is also less costly than other options of wood or titanum.
Lastly, the industrial designer presents, discussing the power source of the remote control.
He talks about using plastic with elasticity so that the remote would not break into pieces if it fell, which relates to their earlier discussion about giving it a spongy design.
He suggests that they could have one of two kinds of power supplies- the usual batteries or rechargable ones if there is to be a base station and they could place solar cells on top for times when the lighting is good.
They have the prototype presentation and talk about the final design, features, and power source, type of chip and weight of the remote.
The project manager goes through the minutes of the last meeting.
Infared port on top of banana as well as bottom front of base station.
The volume scroll wheel will be on the left, channel scroll on the right.

They keep the regular chip, stick with plastic, put two scroll wheels and three push buttons, and make it a special shade of yellow.
They briefly evaulate the project process and close the meeting.
They rate each criteria on a scale of 0 (true) to 7 (false): how fancy it is, how handy it is, how functional, how cool it is, whether they would spend twenty five euro for it, and whether they would change their current remote for this one.
Three push buttons.
For pricing reasons eliminate solar cells - use rechargable batteries as power source, base station used for battery-charging which should last 8-10 hours depending on frequency of use.

The user interface designer and industrial designer will work together on a prototype
This last meeting started with the presentation of a remote control prototype.
After the team realised the prototype was over budget, they replaced the battery with a hand dynamo.
The prototype was more than 40% over budget.
Finally, the team evaluated the whole process: they deemed themselves a good team, they found there was plenty of room for creativity and they liked the project manager's leadership.
The prototype was evaluated on a scale of 1(excellent)-7(very bad) in terms of fancifulness, technology, robustness, usefulness, size, colour and shape and customizability: the average mark was 2.17; the team were satisfied with their prototype, although after costs were calculated it proved very expensive.
The team realised that their budget did not allow for all the specifications of their prototype.
The casing will be made of titanium with rubber strawberries following the fruit and veg fashion.
The gratuitous presence of decorative rubber strawberries on a titanium case (even if they cover sensors) did not meet everyone's approval.
Although, the attempt was towards keeping with the current fashion trends, the result did not satisfy the program manager.
It also includes speech recognition as an alternative interface, which also serves as mechanism for locating the device.
It has on-off and volume buttons, an LCD screen (it can be active or switched off) in various colours, which largely replaces the use of push buttons, and a jog-wheel for navigation and option selection in the menus presented on the LCD.
When it became evident from the costs of components and materials that they would have to do without either the LCD or the speech recognition, they decided to change the given prices in order to accommodate them to their design and budget.

Individual must come up with their ideas for the next meeting.
They will look further at the idea of covers in the mext meeting too.
The interface specialist will look at button and over all look.
The considered options for the shape of the remote control, imagining how it would fit in the hand.
Specific ideas as to components and materials are to be left to the next meeting.
The group ended the discussion by touching very briefly on some materials issues, and discussed remote covers.
They considered taking the best of their competitors designs and making a multifunction remote.
It needs to be useable internationally, with few buttons.
Other functions are served by push buttons: OK, menu, screen sizing, AV, settings buttons, mute, digits 1-9, power, volume control, channel up/down with the last three types being prominent on the device.
The exact design and placement of the components will be decided in the next meeting.
The team agreed to follow a user-centred approach and simplify the design by somehow minimising the number of buttons.
They plan to include an LCD screen to display relevant information.
Functions like zapping are very prevalent, as well as complaints about remotes being difficult to learn and easy to lose.
The function of the remote is relatively simple: by pressing a button a current is passed to the chip, and defines what signal is to be sent to the receiver (the TV) via infrared.
The target group will be people below 30.
It transpires that customers are willing to pay more for fancier looking remotes, especially if they include LCD screens and speech recognition.
The less frequently used buttons will not be hidden under a flip, as it had been previously suggested, as there are not that many of them; they will just be clearly separated from the more important ones.
A discussion on ergonomic solutions like placing the main buttons (power, channel selection, volume) where they can be easily reached with the thumb (as many users complain of RSI), did not reach a conclusion as to whether this would actually cause more repetitive movements.
The team agreed to follow a user-centred approach and simplify the design by somehow minimising the number of buttons.
There are some new requirements for the project: the device will have to be for TV only, they should ignore the teletext function, as it is dated, and, also, the remote should be recognisable as a Real Reaction product.
An LCD screen is going to be used to display information, but would not be interactive.
The buttons are going to include: OK, menu, screen sizing, AV, settings buttons, mute, digits 1-9, power, volume control, channel up/down.
There is no need for a special button to recognise two-digit numbers.
Some advanced features, like LCD screen with program information or speech recognition, would be very important in order to attract their target group, but there are costing issues that have not been clarified yet.
There was some disagreement as to whether the LCD screen should be placed at the top or the bottom of the remote.
Each member of the team will come for the next meeting with their views on function and design issues that they had not time to consolidate during this meeting.
The solution to complaints about remote controls being difficult to learn is to focus on an intuitive design instead of a thorough manual.
No consensus was reached regarding the positioning of the main buttons (zapping, volume, power) either: should they be placed close together or more scattered (to avoid RSI complaints)?
The idea of interchangeable fronts was mentioned again; if it were adopted, the company should be recognisable in all the available fronts as well as the remote itself.
A special AV button for direct access to the video channel, although its necessity was disputed, because there are alternative solutions that make it obsolete.
The team drew a provisional prototype.
They placed the LCD below the buttons.
If it is implemented, a recording button, microphone and speaker need to be included in the design.
Materials also need to be strong: the marketing expert suggested an iron-plate or titanium front.
The industrial designer suggested they use rubber push buttons (and no scroll wheel), simple battery (instead of solar cells or kinetic dynamo), and advanced chip.
Speech recognition can be implemented, but it does not link speech commands to remote control actions.
He also advised that the users within the target group prefer primary colours, soft textures and curved shapes.
The version of speech recognition discussed does not link voice commands to actual device actions.
Changing the front colours may make the front clash with the titanium, but it was also thought neutral enough for it not to matter.
They wondered whether to use both the logo and the slogan on the device and where it would be best for them to be placed.
The case will be titanium with a plastic front with rounded buttons.
Parts of the front (like the bottom where the LCD is and the top corner where the logo is) will also be titanium.
The chip is going to be a standard one.
They will launch the product with various fronts to choose from including a couple of basic colours or fruit and vegetable themes to go with the current fashion.
The logo will be both at the front and the back of the remote; the company slogan will be engraved at the back.
The team found a possible conflict between the need for strong materials and the customers' preference for soft textures.
Plastic may be strong, but it does not necessarily look it.
Making changeable fascias can allow for the integration of this or future fashion trends in the device.
The team agreed to place the LCD at the bottom of the device, below the buttons.
TV settings will be included in menus there instead of having separate buttons for them.
They will implement speech recognition as well, because their target group like such gimmicks.
For the conceptual design, the marketing expert talked about the public's preference for looks and texture over technological innovation; however, they both seem to be more important than ease of use.
Finally, they decided to have a titanium case with plastic front and the company logo and slogan engraved.
The current fashion among younger people favours bright colours and fruit and vegetable themes: pertinent exchangeable fronts can express such trends on the remote.
Packages with a variety of changeable fronts will be launched.
The industrial designer and the user interface designer will work on a drawing of a prototype, where they will also sort out the details about the buttons.
The marketing expert will carry out an evaluation of the product.
The push buttons are going to be made of rubber.
The chip needs to be an advanced one to be compatible with the LCD screen that is going to be incorporated in the design.
The LCD can be found at the lower section of the device.
After the presentation, the product was evaluated.
The back has the logo and slogan of the company engraved in its middle.
The buttons include oval digit buttons, arrow-shaped channel and volume controls in the middle; below those, is the menu (for the LCD) and the video button.
This was done on a scale of 1(excellent)-7(very bad) on fancifulness, ease of use, finding the device when it is lost, hi-tech features, incorporation of fashion trends, and ergonomic design.
Because it was over budget, titanium was replaced by plastic and the speech recognition was discarded.
Replacing the titanium with plastic would have a detrimental effect on the looks of the remote.
The only way was to go to a regular chip, but that would mean losing the LCD screen, which was integral to the design.
The sample speaker was taken out to bring the cost of the prototype down to the original budget of 12.50 euros.
Despite disagreement regarding the position of the LCD (top or bottom), the screen was left at the bottom as it was in the prototype.
Some people thought that there was no advantage to using the SMARTboard instead of a normal blackboard and chalk, although you can save and reuse things with the former.
The SMARTboard was considered a disaster as they could not draw, and the digital pens can only be useful for drawings.
The team discussed the possibility to leave the remaining cost at 14.10.
Finally, the team evaluated the project process in terms of creativity (generally satisfied), leadership (the process was democratic, not happy with management), teamwork (happy with it), and means (SMARTboard was 'a disaster' and the digital pens only good for drawings).
The total cost of the prototype was 18.6 euros.
The project manager still disagreed on the position of the LCD: he would prefer it to be at the top.
There was criticism for the shape of the remote (thicker at the ends, thinner at the middle).
They also decided to replace titanium with similar-looking plastic for the same reason.
It is rounded, with the front made of hard plastic in different colours.
The back, as well as the lower part of the front are made of titanium.
The ID and UI presented the drawing of a prototype.
For the first meeting, the task of designing a remote control was briefly introduced along with the plan for the subsequent meetings.
They then offered suggestions as to what they would like from their remote.
They would like the remote to be durable, for it to include a device to help find it when lost and not use too many batteries.
The group then drew animals to practise using the drawing platform.
They discussed their likes and dislikes regarding current remote controls, including ease of use, multiple systems and power indicators.
The group then discussed their target group ,and what features they might include to attract them.
The Marketing Expert present the findings of the usability study.
The User Interface Designer very briefly mentioned some features a remote should have and suggested it should be multifunctional.
He also suggested mobile phone-like changeable covers, and the group discussed the profit in this.
The Industrial Designer briefly explained the internal workings of the remote,  and mentioned his preferences for power source and case material.
The project manager opened the meeting by explaining how to locate his minutes from the previous meeting.
The buttons will consist of number, a menu button, arrows for changing channel and volume, but also navigating the menu, and a mute button.
The design of the remote control is to be carried out at the next meeting.
Individual actions for the next meeeting can be found in emails to be sent.
The group then discussed what buttons they might need, which included menu, numbers, channel and volume changing arrows and mute.
The manager introduced new requirements to the project, insisting they were to be followed.
Whether to have a trigger-shaped power button.
If they can use a menu on the TV screen if the remote does not have an LCD.
Whether to use a joystick rather than a scroll button to navigate the menu.
The case will be made of hard plastic and rubber.
The remote will use a normal battery.
There was a lack of information about the cost of an LCD screen.
Whether to use an LCD screen or not.
He talked about the possibility of using a scroll button, and the different chips which could be used.
The group discussed using an LCD screen, but did not have enough information about costs to make a decision.
The marketing expert talked about new trends, including the trends for spongy materials and fruit and vegetable themed products.
The group had a discussion and decided to create two designs, one with an LCD screen and one without, and the interface designer drew them on the board.
The industrial designer gave a presentation on the interface concept, discussing which buttons will be needed and then looking at some examples of existing remote controls.
He suggested using a yellow case with rounded edges and the logo at the bottom, and large, clearly marked buttons.
The interface expert informed the group that young people like curved shapes, soft materials and primary colours, and suggested making a hand-shaped remote in plastic and rubber.
The industrial designer and user interface designer will stay in the room to design the prototypes.
They put off making a final decision about using an LCD screen, scroll buttons and a menu button until they could find out about costs.
The interface designer will find out how much an LCD screen will cost.
Which features should be removed or changed.
Which chip would be needed for the revised design.
There was some confusion about the agenda.
The production costs of the initial design came to fifteen Euros, so the design had to be changed.
Finally the project manager led an evaluation of the project process before closing the meeting.
The group discussed how to make the design cheaper, and decided to keep the LCD screen, but to remove the special colour and replace the joystick with regular push-buttons.
The project manager calculated the production costs, which were too high at fifteen Euros.
The overall rating was two.
Led by the marketing expert, the group evaluated the prototype on a scale of one to seven, based on a set of evaluation criteria.
The industrial designer and user interface designer presented their prototype design, made of yellow rubber and hard plastic, with large, mostly blue buttons, a joystick and LCD screen.
The remote will have regular push-buttons instead of a joystick.
The remote will be a normal colour rather than a special colour.
The remote will have an LCD screen.
Overall, the group were satisfied with the creativity, teamwork and available equipment, although the marketing expert thought the SMARTboard and laptops were sometimes distracting and not that helpful.
They will receive information from their personal coaches.
The group will design a trendy, original and user-friendly remote control.
The remote control will be sold for 25 euros with a profit aim of 50 million euros.
The remote will be sold internationally.
It was felt that the low production costs would not allow them to create a trendy high-end product.
Whether using glow in the dark buttons and bluetooth would mean that the remote consumes too much energy.
The project manager closed the meeting.
Each member of the group will work on their individual tasks.
They also discussed having glow in the dark buttons, using bluetooth instead of infrared and using a display and/or a joystick instead of conventional buttons.
However, they were unsure about what the budget would allow.
The project manager suggested that the remote should be rechargeable or not use much power, but this might be difficult if using bluetooth.
The project manager then went over the project budget.
The production costs should be no more than 12.50 euros.
The industrial designer gave a brief presentation about his role and his initial ideas for the project, suggesting that the remote should be used for multiple devices and that the group should consider using bluetooth rather than infrared.
The remote will control multiple devices.
The project manager then asked the others about their initial ideas.
The remote will be sold directly to individual consumers rather than companies.
The user interface designer agreed that the remote should control multiple devices.
The group were unsure about whether they would be selling their product directly to consumers or to electronics manufacturers.
The project manager opened the meeting and introduced the project, describing what the project would involve, the role of each participant and the agenda for the first meeting.
He the demonstrated the equipment the group would be using, and the group practiced using the SMARTboard by drawing their favourite animals.
The latter would be preferable to implementing a backlight into the remote.
It would be a good idea to integrate a mechanism for finding the remote control, when the user loses it.
Using them sparsely, as in mobile phones, could bring down the cost.
LED's can be used to light up the remote.
It's difficult to choose a technique to find a lost remote.
Power-saving LED's are available, but these could be more expensive.
LED's would signify extra energy consumption.
A recharging cradle can be added to compensate for the extra energy consumption.
The remote will also include volume and program selection, and speech recognition.
Another button to switch between two channels could also be implemented.
A single, large, round button can be used for both volume and channel selection by using the four separate quadrants.
It also transpires that customers like innovative technology like speech recognition.
Functions like zapping are very prevalent, as well as complaints about remotes being easy to lose.
The function of the remote is relatively simple: by pressing a button a current is passed to the chip, and defines what signal is to be sent to the receiver (the TV) via infrared.
The UI preferred an easy-to-use remote to a multi-function one.
Adding such features may complicate the design and escalate costs.
The remote could light up via LED's placed inside.
Similarly, using an extra base station would probably be too costly.
The use of infrared, energy-efficient power source and cheap circuit was suggested.
They cannot install a special button on a TV, and using a special signal, like clapping, is tricky, because it needs to be differentiated from normal sounds.
The target group will be people below 40.
There are some new requirements for the project: the device will have to be for TV only, they should ignore the teletext function, as it is dated, and, also, the remote should be recognisable as a Real Reaction product.
The marketing expert will need to find information on current trends.
The UI will present the user interface concept.
The ID will present the components concept.
An expanded target group may have to be taken into account in order to achieve the projected sales and profits.
The project manager will add the minutes into the project folder.
The industrial designer will look into what would be an appropriate technology to help users find their remote, when it is lost.
However, this solution may prove too expensive.
The functions of the remote will include a back button to switch between two channels, volume, program selection, and speech recognition, with a focus on simplicity of design.
The discussion also focused on their replacement with speech recognition, as the latter helps with locating the remote as well.
Despite that, customers may want them to be on a remote; furthermore, they can be designed in a more attractive way.
There was a challenge regarding the need of the digit channels, based on the fact that they are not often used, and they also look dull.
It was debated that customers may prefer a total spongy texture, not just in the buttons and the sides of the remote.
The front could have a rubber finish, or the buttons will be made of rubber.
Printing an image on the remote to make it more colourful is doable, but cannot be done by the manufacturing department.
The company colours (grey and yellow and black) did not seem sufficiently bright and trendy to everyone.
The team will design a single-curved device with a scroll wheel and speech recognition, in black and yellow, the company colours.
The ID and UI will also have to figure out whether to use rubber just for the buttons and side finish, or for the whole front of the remote.
They will also try to find a way to promote the corporate identity in the design of the look and feel and interface.
The industrial designer and the user interface designer will work on a drawing of a prototype.
Hand or kinetic dynamos, batteries, and solar cells can be used as energy sources.
Possible interfaces are push buttons, scroll wheels, and LCDs. A way to make this device different would be to use a scroll-wheel on the side with integrated button for volume control and mute.
A scroll wheel will be included in the design.
Changeable covers for the remote control can link the product to current fashion trends, but also trends followed by other age groups.
Cases can be flat, single- or double-curved.
They can be made of plastic, rubber, wood or titanium.
The marketing expert will carry out a product evaluation.
Speech recognition can be implemented by adding a sample sensor and speaker on the remote.
A single-curved rubber casing can also be used.
The final decisions also included combined battery with solar cells.
The current fashion among younger people favours bright colours and fruit and vegetable themes and spongy materials: pertinent exchangeable fronts can express such trends on the remote, and could also provide themes for other target groups.
They could also add some rubber to provide easy grip of the device.
For the conceptual design, the marketing expert talked about the public's preference for looks over technological innovation; however, they both seem to be more important than ease of use.
The preferred energy source was a combination of batteries and solar cells.
LCD is not going to be implemented.
LCD screens may add an extra hi-tech touch, but given all the other features, it might be too much.
Using the speech recognition on the device may not be convenient, since the remote will have to pointing towards the TV at the same time for the infrared to work.
The use of a scroll wheel with integrated button was debated, as not everyone was convinced of its use for this project.
It is not clear whether a kinetic dynamo can be used, because it is unlikely that a user shakes the remote enough, as one would do with similarly powered watches.
An extra button could activate/deactivate the voice recognition.
The delay in providing costs of components was criticised.
The prototype proved extremely over budget.
The prototype will have to be redesigned, so that it is compatible with the budget constraints..
The main contributing factors were the solar cell and speech recognition.
The device cannot be a hi-tech, innovative one any more.
The criteria used were fancifulness (2), technological innovation (2), ease of use (2.5), whether it is easy to find (1), sponginess (1.5), number of features (1).
One way to compensate for the loss of features, but still attract their target group, would be to add more colour to the design.
Finally, the team evaluated the project process in terms of creativity (choices too narrow), leadership and teamwork (happy with it, but they missed communicating in between meetings), and means (SMARTboard was not satisfactory, but the digital pens were alright, but not too useful).
After the costing, the original prototype was evaluated on a scale of 1(excellent)-7(very bad).
It was suggested that they go for a completely simple design so as to maximise the profit, although this was not what was asked in the project requirements.
It can be used as a normal remote, but the speech recognition also provides a more advanced alternative interface.
The speech recognition works as a finding mechanism as well.
The rubber case is yellow with grey or black, with buttons either made of plastic or rubber.
It would cost 22 euros.
The team thought all the changes to accommodate the budget requirements made a very dull device.
The prototype proved extremely over budget.
The idea to include a solar cell as a power source had to be abandoned, due to the escalated costs.
The same happened with the speech recognition.
The project will be completed with three further meetings: the following meeting concerns the functional design.
The project manager gave a quick overview of the equipment available.
The goal of the project is to design an original, trendy and user-friendly remote control for TV.
The team comprises the project manager, the marketing expert, who is looking at user needs, the user interface designer, looking at usability, and the industrial designer, working on the engineering and materials.
Afterwards, they discussed briefly their first ideas, including the use of light materials and usability concerns.
They also agreed to choose light materials.
The design should generally be intuitive without changes that would render it an unfamiliar object to customers.
The remote  needs to be produced for 12.50 euros in order to be sold for double that amount.
The whole team tried out the SMARTboard, by drawing their favourite animals.
The team will also take into account possible usability issues concerning disabled people.
The remote is just going to be for TV.
They like innovative technology like speech recognition and LCD screens.
Symbols on remotes fade with time.
The most used buttons are going to be placed on top.
It also transpires that remotes are easy to lose.
The industrial designer wondered whether the remote should be universal or programmable.
Everyone agreed that they need to incorporate a locating mechanism in their design, and that changeable covers could make appealing-looking remotes.
Different TVs have different functions incorporated in their built-in menus, making it hard to know in advance which buttons you can do without on the remote.
The need for clarity of button functions was mentioned.
It may not be technically possible for a universal remote control to create menus for various advanced settings on the TV itself.
It might be possible to use a charger for the remote.
On the other hand, materials should be more durable.
The team also discussed extensively the positioning of various buttons.
He will also check into the importance and possibility of using rechargeable batteries and a charger.
The function of the remote is relatively simple: by pressing a button a current is passed to the chip, and defines what signal is to be sent to the receiver (the TV) via infrared.
The ID will present the components concept.
Consumers claim they would pay more for a remote with LCD screen, but adding the component might be too expensive.
There are some new requirements: the target group will be people below 40, the device will have to be for TV only, they should ignore the teletext function, and, also, the remote should be recognisable as a Real Reaction product.
He will also draw some ideas for the shape of the remote.
They drew some of their ideas, and discussed the positioning of the buttons and the LCD.
Using a charger for the remote may be too expensive.
Speech recognition and LCD screens could be added to the remote control, but they might be too expensive for this project.
Customers are willing to pay more for fancier looking remotes.
The important buttons will be on top.
The remote will need to be different from those available in the market in terms of shape and colour.
The target group will be people below 40.
Buttons should be made bigger, with clearly defined functions and of durable materials to avoid fading of the symbols.
The company colours and slogan will have to be shown on the device.
A button that sticks on the TV could be pressed to make the lost remote beep, and perhaps also light up.
It would be a good idea to integrate a mechanism for finding the remote control, when the user loses it.
Because symbols may fade, the additional covers could include those.
The remote is going to be a universal one.
The team will also examine whether they can use an LCD and/or speech recognition.
The marketing expert will need to find information on current trends and see into the financial issues concerning the integration of a charger.
In the case where it is added, the issue would be whether to place it at the top or the bottom of the remote.
Finally, they will try to think of a name for their product.
The UI and ID presented a prototype drawing of the remote control design.
The rubber case is yellow with black buttons and dark yellow for the menus.
There are buttons for teletext, favourite channel, mute and OK.
Everyone agreed that the financial information should not have been given to them at the last moment.
After the costing, the original prototype was evaluated on a scale of 1(excellent)-7(very bad).
The criteria used were look and feel (1), whether it is easy to find (1), whether it is easy to learn (2), use of LCD (3), speech recognition (7), trendiness (2).
It incorporates both LCD screen and speech recognition.
Finally, the team evaluated the project process in terms of creativity (satisfactory), leadership and teamwork (happy with it, but they missed communicating in between meetings), and means (SMARTboard could be improved in terms of response time, the digital pens could not be used on more than one page at the same time).
The prototype proved over budget (17 euros).
Finally, the decided to call their design Triple-R.
The PM is going to finish the project report.
The latter was taken out, along with the special colour.
The UI and ID will send him their design to include.
The team were unable to communicate amongst themselves in between meetings, which hindered the flow of information.
There was disagreement over whether the special colour should be scrapped and the look to rely on the separate covers.
Other solutions, like abandoning the curve of the casing or replace the rubber with plastic were also suggested.
They were also not allowed to raise the budget limit.
The precise use of the LCD was not defined: it could be used for TV configuration, or, if possible, for displaying the TV programme and previews.
Although the SMARTboard was useful to draw ideas quickly , it could be improved in terms of response time.
Similarly, the digital pens did not allow the user to work on more than one page at a time.
Because the prototype was over budget, the team decided to take out the speech recognition from the design.
They also discarded the special colour, and decided to rely on the changeable covers for an attractive look.
The remote control is going to be called Triple-R.
The production cost was 17 euros, 4.5 more than the budget.
It was imperative that some of the features had to be taken out.
