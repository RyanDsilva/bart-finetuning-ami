my name's Adam Duguid, Ebenezer Ademesoye. I'm the Marketing Expert. Tarik Rahman. T_A_R_I_K_. Industrial Designer., Dave Cochrane. And you're going to be the User Interface,
This is the agenda for today's meeting. As you can see, w opening, acquaintance, tool training, project plan discussion, and closing. the reason we're here, we're gonna design a new remote control, The very broad overview is original, trendy, and user-friendly. We're gonna have the three kay phases, the functional, architectural, and the detailed design. First one's gonna be covering the user requirement spec, technical functions, working design. Second seems to be conceptual components, properties, materials, and the last one is a detailed analysis of our design so far. Ebenezer, you wanna have a you wanna draw your favourite animal? Here we have an elephant. Tarik, would you like to have a shot at a bit of artistry?, here we have a tiger. Dave, if you'd like to have a dash., the monkey,. but cats are one of my favourite animals,
Project finance. As you can see, twelve point five Euros per unit. and we're hoping to sell them for twenty five. If we're aiming for fifty million Euros we're gonna have to be selling an awful lot of them. that was profiting,
do you think they should have some sort of stick on it, rather than buttons? Like control pads, you know of games, and that could allow n easy navigation, used as a joystick as well.
Any ideas of where you think a new remote control could go into this market? one thing I'm aware of is, th there at the sort of v very high price end of the market there's there's a em emerging market for sort of touch screen L_C_D_ remotes that can be programmed in m much more sophisticated ways than sort of conventional models, b it occurs to me there might be a niche for for a remote that aimed towards some of that sort of functionality but using a just conventional push button design. And therefore putting it into a well much lower price bracket. with the price range we're looking at, going for a touch screen would probably be possibly out of our Absolutely prohibitive, But you think again something to control multiple units in a simple fashion. I mean you get ones that you can switch between multiple units, and ideally something into which it would have some at least limited facility for running macros. Would the the idea something along the lines of, one on button would turn on say the video recorder, the T_V_, maybe the sound system as well, all in one go, is that kind of you pr you press say the play button for the D_V_D_ player and it turns the T_V_ on and onto the right channel as well, I've noticed that gaming c is becoming quite popular with television, we used to e play games using our cable, using the cable subscribed the cable providers, but our remote controls would get worn out really easily, I've seen the bar-code design before, Instead of people entering in what time things start, you simply stri slide a bar to say what time it begins, and the remote control was not a great kind of keyboar, keypad, for playing games. I think for gaming, you know you want you want some big buttons for up, down, left and right, shoot., you wanna be able to change angles in interactive television, so we'll have to try and decide on some of the basic functionality, that'll be
But you think again something to control multiple units in a simple fashion. I mean you get ones that you can switch between multiple units, Would the the idea something along the lines of, one on button would turn on say the video recorder, the T_V_, maybe the sound system as well, all in one go, is that kind of you pr you press say the play button for the D_V_D_ player and it turns the T_V_ on and onto the right channel as well,
so we'll have to try and decide on some of the basic functionality,, how the user interface might work,
Project finance. As you can see, twelve point five Euros per unit.
and we're hoping to sell them for twenty five.
Mm-hmm. The other key feature that that would be a good idea built into it is t is is to make something you know fairly sort of ergonomic, something that just fits fits as comfortably as possible into the hand. Something sort of sort of sl slightly sort of biomorphic in form,
one thing I'm aware of is, th there at the sort of v very high price end of the market there's there's a em emerging market for sort of touch screen L_C_D_ remotes with the price range we're looking at, going for a touch screen would probably be possibly out of our Absolutely prohibitive,
we could maybe even go as far as saying power button, small joystick, L_C_D_,
the other option of course is that the The clapping one. digital telephones, for example, one unit has somewhere where there's a button, of course you have to have that base unit, but maybe it's a button that you attach to the T_V_. Something which you when you press that, it would beep to give its location away, on the remote unit. again say what, it would be a small transmitter, watch battery type scenario I would say, So that would require a transmitter maybe attached to the T_V_, and what, a basically a small microphone on the actual unit, Light bulb as well, a small speaker you mean. th e the true fact, considering the cost of an L_E_D_, we could just incorporate it anyway.
do we go for a small joystick that would operate say changing channels, up and down, we have to decide exactly what we're going to do with the remote. and then, what, another button that would say that it's now being used to manoeuvre round the L_C_D_. Should volume be important in the joystick, do you think? We could use say the left and right for changing channels we could maybe even go as far as saying power button, small joystick, L_C_D_, and with the possibility of pushing down on the joystick to say okay? Actually I would say maybe two two function buttons, the y we're now using the menus button and and an og and an okay button. I mean certainly something I've found with the joystick on mo the joysticks on mobile phones is that a lot of the time th the device mistakes you trying to move it in one direction or the other for pushing down for okay. The o the o the other dis design constraint I think we should bear in mind is that people are you know very much used to using a remote control one handedly, Do we incorporate the idea of trying to f locate the remote control again via a beeping noise? Yeah, think so. So that would require a transmitter maybe attached to the T_V_, and what, a basically a small microphone on the actual unit, Light bulb as well, a small speaker you mean. th e the true fact, considering the cost of an L_E_D_, we could just incorporate it anyway. you could go for quite an interesting design. something that can make it stand out slightly. I should just look at the speaker, the speaker and an L_E_D_.
we could maybe even go as far as saying power button, small joystick, L_C_D_,
also key is the corporate image should stay recognisable, f your colour and slogan of course is down at the bottom there.
I mean most of the of the replacement remote market is sort of remote control rationalisation. you want one wo y you want one that'll do the job of all of them. this is a requirement that we have to stick to I'm afraid, would that include access to say interactive functions on digital or cable? I would say so, yes, I would say that the design spec we've been with is for the television only for now.
Remote control should only be used for the T_V_. due for time to market and possibly also cost issues.
I imagine as well that the actual L_C_D_ and maybe to a certain extent the joystick as well would be for the additional functionality. if you i if you wanted to access further functions i you you then get to sort of menu navigation. I mean with things like ch with things like tuning and channels you know adjusting brightn brightness and fiddly things that no one really bothers with, most T_V_s these days actually have menus anyway and then, what, another button that would say that it's now being used to manoeuvre round the L_C_D_.
Teletext has become outdated due to the populat popularity of the internet.
I'm responsible for working design,, this is basically the inside going on of the the remote control. So we have the energy source, we have the user interface, the sender will push the button, the chip will respond, Do we need many buttons, or do we need l many light bulbs, the joystick is another thing, if we were gonna add that,, there'd be more components to deal with that. you have the energy source obviously connected to the chip, You have the switch turn it on, infrared bulb, will contact the T_V_ do we need on the control different buttons to decide, or different light bulbs,, I dunno what we should decide on that.
I I was thinking that the remote the sort of default functions for the joystick would be up and down for volume, left and right for channels. I imagine as well that the actual L_C_D_ and maybe to a certain extent the joystick as well would be for the additional functionality. maybe we have the fol the joystick as a separate one for the other functions then, do we go for a small joystick that would operate say changing channels, up and down, Should volume be important in the joystick, do you think? We could use say the left and right for changing channels and with the possibility of pushing down on the joystick to say okay? I mean certainly something I've found with the joystick on mo the joysticks on mobile phones is that a lot of the time th the device mistakes you trying to move it in one direction or the other for pushing down for okay.
this is a brief run through of the of the technical functions of the remote. the presentation is already slightly obsolete because I had in mind something that would be i be aimed at controlling multiple devices I've looked at looked at a num couple of other remote control models just for an idea of basic design principles. basically the job of the device is to send commands to an appliance, in this case the television set. and there's two main trends in th in the sort of design practice. On the one hand and this this particularly relates to its sort of earliest models where with you know i so so many buttons on it giving you every possible function that the that the device has, the remote control controls. it creates a rather user unfriendly interface. And on the other hand there's a user focused approach that pares things down to just what what is most likely to get used. and of course there is a certain amount of sort of loss of function here obviously, And so you go for something that's fairly intuitive to use, My own view is that we should definitely be going for a user focused design. but the pro I think the problem with a lot of the sort of user focused designs that are about is that they sort of make assumptions in advance about what what a given user's going to want mo want to do from want it to do most. something that's something that is more programmable, that perh perhaps has the full range of functions available to it but you can then specify yourself what you're most likely to want. I liked Ebenezer's idea of including a joystick in that and possibly a sort of fairly minimal number of sort of function buttons, you then have some sort of basic display on it so that if you're sort of cha changing from different modes for the device it'll tell you just exactly what you know each direction of the of the joystick's going to do or wha or
but if you can control almost all of the functionality from the display, I don't know how much power an L_C_D_ would take, literally if you can imagine the display maybe slightly larger than those on a a mobile phone, something where you can read an an fair amount of information, traverse maybe quite a few menus, Do you think that people will get mixed up, they'll be looking at this screen and that screen I think probably for the first couple of hours of using it
but I think we don't have a specific audience, like what is our target audience, I think it could probably be aimed at most people who've used a mobile., if we are if we were to follow that avenue, we might be s you know we're kind of almost relying on their experience with a mobile phone I suppose. maybe then our market should be T_V_ manufacturers, rather than the public. However I don't know exactly where we'll be going with that, It's just, the way I figure it, twelve point five Euros per unit, we have to sell at least like three million or something like that,, if we do end up trying to market this to television manufacturers then the then the transmitter could actually be built into the television.
I hear what the Marketing Expert's saying about voice activated control. However I've got a couple of worries about that. The power required, and the ability to the cost, it seems like for an embedded system, this could cause us issues. voice activation could be an interesting idea but I think that our Ind Industrial Designer would probably upon some research say that it's maybe not feasible. however the idea of a joystick and then maybe an L_C_D_ which has been kind of put forward so far, but if you can control almost all of the functionality from the display, I don't know how much power an L_C_D_ would take, literally if you can imagine the display maybe slightly larger than those on a a mobile phone, something where you can read an an fair amount of information, traverse maybe quite a few menus, and then we could have like say the common buttons as you say, volume control, changing channels I I was thinking that the remote the sort of default functions for the joystick would be up and down for volume, left and right for channels. Do you think that people will get mixed up, they'll be looking at this screen and that screen I think probably for the first couple of hours of using it but we should probably try to stick to black and white. Si si simply to keep m keep the unit cost down. I imagine as well that the actual L_C_D_ and maybe to a certain extent the joystick as well would be for the additional functionality. and you can still have the main buttons that allow the people to turn the machine on and off, d up and down, maybe we have the fol the joystick as a separate one for the other functions then, that there's just a a small number of as you were saying buttons that have already been defined. we go for the nice standard up and down for and volume control. if you i if you wanted to access further functions i you you then get to sort
we'll start with the minutes of the last meeting. discussed the possibility of a macro facility, interac interacting the T_V_ a bit more, mentioning of bar-code, joystick for user manipulation, and ergonomics of the remote control as well. it's come to my attention the following. Teletext has become outdated due to the populat popularity of the internet. Remote control should only be used for the T_V_. due for time to market and possibly also cost issues. also key is the corporate image should stay recognisable, f your colour and slogan of course is down at the bottom there. Just to say quickly I would have thought that only being used for a television the macro facility may now not be required. to the point in my opinion anyway that it might not be worth pursuing. if anybody disagrees we can definitely say so. I'd like to if possible hear from our Marketing Expert first,
Finally, my opinion. The voice recognition thing is cool. And voice recognition, the software, open source software exist already. It's a bit sketchy at some times,, you're not gonna get good always accurate results, but for a very fixed number of words, how many different words can you have for a remote control, up, down, left, right, channel five, channel seven, For a fixed vocabulary it works quite well. I'm pretty sure people would buy it. I mean most people use a remote control for switching to channels, So if you have to say up, up, up, up, if you have to do that all the time, then people might get a bit fed up with that However, oh, because the voice recognition software exists already, there's no need to spend money on research and development, but this does mean the need for microphones in the in the remote control, which is an unusual feature in my opinion. But if we do have the voice recognition thing, there's a lot of stuff that you can get rid of. there're two options. Either you have voice recognition by itself, which I think is a bit impractical for like night time if you wanna be watching television and you wanna be quiet, or I don't know you have a visitor coming round and the remote's only trained for you, it's a bit impractical to have just voice recognition by itself. So you can have voice recognition and a regular remote. But imagine you got rid of the regular remote part, then you can design the remote to look any way you want it to look, but is it practical to have a voice recognition system in a remote control,, will people will people be willing to wait for the the period that it'll take to train the remote, I think a lot of young people will buy the remote control, if they have the money, but would they return it after a while
Functional requirement by me Ebenezer. we did some research, we asked one hundred people their opinions on remote controls. We asked some open ended questions, and we asked some very specific questions, Please bear in mind this is only a hundred people, so even when the groups are divided into fifteen to twenty five, twenty five to thirty five, there's only maybe ten people fifteen people in each group. some the bad stuff we got, remotes are often lost. Most buttons are not used any more, like you said, teletext is outdated now. there's just a lot of stuff that no one really uses. Takes too long to master the remote control. I've seen some remote controls that are big, they have a lot of buttons, you have to hold down more than one key at one time to do something, Some of the good stuff we got. Between the age of fifteen and twenty five, most people would be willing to pay extra for voice recognition software. most people want remote controls to be pretty, they want it to be fancy, th they they want it to be different,
However, oh, because the voice recognition software exists already, So if you have to say up, up, up, up, if you have to do that all the time, then people might get a bit fed up with that I'm pretty sure people would buy it. For a fixed vocabulary it works quite well. And voice recognition, the software, open source software exist already. The voice recognition thing is cool. but for a very fixed number of words, It's a bit sketchy at some times,, you're not gonna get good always accurate results, I mean most people use a remote control for switching to channels, there's no need to spend money on research and development, but this does mean the need for microphones in the in the remote control, which is an unusual feature in my opinion. But if we do have the voice recognition thing, there's a lot of stuff that you can get rid of. there're two options.

So you can have voice recognition and a regular remote. But imagine you got rid of the regular remote part, then you can design the remote to look any way you want it to look, but is it practical to have a voice recognition system in a remote control,, will people will people be willing to wait for the the period that it'll take to train the remote, I think a lot of young people will buy the remote control, if they have the money, but would they return it after a while I hear what the Marketing Expert's saying about voice activated control. However I've got a couple of worries about that. The power required, and the ability to the cost, it seems like for an embedded system, this could cause us issues. voice
Do we incorporate the idea of trying to f locate the remote control again via a beeping noise? Yeah, think so.
and with the possibility of pushing down on the joystick to say okay?
we could maybe even go as far as saying power button, small joystick, L_C_D_,
say something like lithium ion battery,
product evaluation, doesn't that come after actually seen a product prototype. you're gonna look at product evaluation.
you've got yourself and the Industrial Designer gonna be working quite closely at this stage looking from prototyping of some des description using clay. looks like we're gonna need a maybe a kind of prototype in clay.
Seems like a a lot of the components could be off the shelf, having the use of the L_C_D_ and the joystick would probably allow you to manipulate enough channel numbers if you've got a lot of channels, the number keypad can be quite annoying as well, what it looks like to me is we'll use a large number of standard components,, say something like lithium ion battery, Looks like we going for a double curved design. I don't know what cost implications there are in that., looks like we're pretty much decided on some kind of flexible rubber. Though I'd have to say depending on how flexible it is, we might need to have some kind of inner frame. there would be basically two points of articulation. W one below and one above the m the the main sort of grip. Do you think there's any way we could maybe remove the articulation? but it could be a weak point in the structure, do you think? If you then have a sort of outer skin of flexible, spongy rubber then you have something that is you know very much you know organic, if we take some of the ideas why don't we make the damn thing yellow to incorporate the des the colour of the logo? Sure, yeah. Make it harder to lose, as well. The noise for when you lose the banana, f yeah, for when you lose the remote control, it could be like a a monkey noise or something like that, rather than a standard beep beep. y you lose the banana, you press a button, and you hear like monkey screams or something like that to direct you towards the banana. I was gonna talk about the programmable remote control. Now I think it'd be cool if you had one remote control that could work with all T_V_s, you s you click a button and it finds the frequency that works with your particular television. e each manufacturer will have a partic will have a particular command set that the T_V_ responds to. But if we
Programming them can be a right pain. So I thought th the simplest way around that would be to have a cable to connect it to the computer some some fair iv fairly fairly simple software on the computer just so that you on your computer And you could download programs for it from for T_V_s from all sort of main manufacturers. I was gonna talk about the programmable remote control. Now I think it'd be cool if you had one remote control that could work with all T_V_s, you s you click a button and it finds the frequency that works with your particular television. e each manufacturer will have a partic will have a particular command set that the T_V_ responds to. But if we had some sort of hook-up to your computer as an option, then if you've got a computer you can avoid that rather irritating thing. An interesting point is that if the person doesn't have the computer, we can still make the process easier because instead of having to look up codes, maybe we can have it that one of the options they have is that they look up the name of the company on the L_C_D_ programming it to use your T_V_, you might hook it up to the P_C_. The the idea was that maybe it could connect up for allowing a software interface on the P_C_ for a larger programming I'm not sure, but I'm thinking maybe that the additional cost of the U_S_B_ might be prohibitive.
like I said before I I think we should have the R_R_ on the on the top function button. So we always need to remember that somewhere we're meant to be getting the slogan on. Possibly I'm think I'm not sure but I'm seeing a little bit of space around maybe the joystick area which could be used..
, looks like we're pretty much decided on some kind of flexible rubber.
Looks like we going for a double curved design.
if we take some of the ideas why don't we make the damn thing yellow to incorporate the des the colour of the logo? Sure, yeah.
We compared whether people want the remote control to do a lot of stuff or they want it to look cool. And then we we research fashion trends in Europe, we found, in order of importance, people want the remote control to look cool more than they want it to to be cool. As in they want it to do a lot of good s and if it does do a lot that's a bonus, but they don't care so much, Technology technical technologically innovative. People want it to be that, but s still they care more about the way it looks than what it does. like the interface is really important. And easy to use, it it just so happens that from the second point to the third point is twice as important I mean the second point is twice as important as the third point. The fashion, now this is seems a bit odd to me, but fruit and veg is the new is the new black for furniture, for clothes, for shoes. How that relates to a remote control I don't know. Spongy. If it's the type of rubber that you can squeeze, you know, it's spongy, then can I skip the rest? The rubber material is the type of stress ball material, not just normal rubber. kinda spongy material. we want something fancy and techni technologically innovative, obviously. But what we what we need is something that looks like it's from the future now the fruit and veg options, either we we go in that direction or we stay totally away from it. but if we're gonna go along with it then it doesn't necessarily have to be like an apple or something like that, or a kiwi fruit. Few questions about a spongy remote control. I've never seen one before. if we want something strong and sturdy, I say stay with plastic or titanium, but if we go with spongy, we can stress that you can drop this as many times as you want, I just don't know how the L_E_D_ and the lights are gonna
I was given a an H_T_M_L_ file giving various ideas from from other previous remote control designs, and pretty much decided to just dump them all. I wasn't very impressed by them nothing I saw seemed to meet the sorts of design specifications that we're going for today. rather than looking at other remotes, ra oomp be better to simply look at the human hand. so that if r a if so that the finger is e each finger or thumb is wherever it needs to be already. and what we've basically decided on was the the the joy the joystick, two function buttons and the L_C_D_, I don't actually think we need the the numeric keypad because one of the menus that we could have available v via via the L_C_D_ is one where you scroll through channels, You must have two two modes, basic mode, where the joystick's left right left right for channels, up down for volume, and the and the menu mode for further functions. now the reason I was particularly interested in using rubber for this is that if we're going to have a highly ergonomic design, it needs to be ergonomic for left or right handed people. That would suggest the double curved design's probably going to be most appropriate, then. And also this is a rather nicer de design gimmick that the the you know the whole thing you know it should have sort of organic feel to it that it should be, you know, soft to touch the the joystick unit should rest over the the joint of the f of the four finger and it would need t there would need to be a it would need to be articulated just below that so that it could be switched around for left or right handed users. And you then have, at the at the bottom, the L_C_D_, and this would need to be articulated as well. the t the top function button in basic mode would be the on off switch and menu mode would be the enter button. And then the
This meeting is the conceptual design phase And is to cover things like what the parts might be made of,, The case le that's what I wrote first of all, could be plastic our plastic. but later on we found out that it can be rubber as well, or titanium or even wood. we decide what it's gonna be. Probably plastic. we need the infra-red transmitter. joystick we'll probably if we're gonna use it, could be plastic w or rubber even as well. three different types of batteries. can either use a hand dynamo, or the kinetic type ones, you know that they use in watches, or else a solar powered one. the bat the battery for a a watch wouldn't require a lot of power, would be my one query. Is a kinetic one going to be able to supply enough power? And solar cells, I dunno about that.. We should probably just use conventional batteries., just like in usual remote controls.. And these are three different types of or two different types three different types of shapes you can have. one is a flat one, and then more original ones are single curved one or one with a double curved. but you can't have a titanium one for a double curved, the single curved and double curved, would you be able to give an example? Double curved. It probably means this is probably double curved. whereas a single curved would be like that. it looks better than the single curve, but you can't have it in titanium, and for the buttons, it can have the scroll wheel but it requires a more expensive chip to use, and if you wanna use L_C_D_ it's even more expensive. there's trade-offs there. you have to decide, if you have a double curve control and it's rubber, then you have these rubber buttons as well. I reckon you're gonna have to have key a number keypad anyway for the amount of channels these days. like when we're saying that we'd need an advanced chip for an L_C_D_, does that in shoot the cost
I think to sum up the last meeting, would be to say the requirements that we've set out. Those are we were going to go for what seemed to be a fairly minimal design based on a small joystick, L_C_D_ and a couple of other buttons for navigation with power being I suppose one of the main single purpose buttons. we were also going to use novelty of being able to locate the remote control again via a small transmitter with any luck, and also because of the minimal design looks like we'll be able to be fairly adventurous in the actual physical shape of our remote control with any luck.
quickly we'll pop onto project evaluation.. we've got these four criteria here for satisfaction. Does anybody want to do you have any opinions on any of them? people made good use of the pen and paper? I'm not quite sure what the advantage for us using a digital pen might be. I think this is a I think the digital pen's mostly for the benefit of the of the researchers studying this. Though it would have been nice to be able to transfer the transfer our n our paper notes onto the computer ourselves. How are people satisfied with the teamwork we've managed to display today? Good. yeah I liked it, Leadership. As much as can be leadered in this thing. Very good. last one we've got is room for creativity. Unti until until accounts came along, We're burs bursting with creativity. We we're not lacking in ideas, I think of in the end, ideas that can be used sadly. Not so much that we weren't full of ideas, but of ones that are gonna allow us to actually build the thing. I think we needed a larger budget.. I mean I th I mean I think to r retaining the s the more sort of bio-morphic form in the articulation would gain more in s would gain more profit in sales than it would lose in I I think it's gone okay today, considering the information that we've had at our disposal, and such. Maybe the counts wou woulda been better if we had a list or more Yeah, to begin with. It is very much a pity to get so far into the stage and then find out that maybe some of your ideas are just a bit too expensive. is there anything else that anybody would like to to add, before I quickly write up a final report. but we've got something we think we can maybe stick onto the the market and sell. I was actually kind of upset you know at the budget, and that we had to cut a lot of stuff.
we have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven. So five, seven, ten, sixteen, twenty one. Which gives us an average of three. it's it's not bad. considering the price we had to get this in, to have a positive you know, even based on the four of us being heavily biased, are people really gonna shell out twenty five Euros for something that's only marginally good?
we've got the use of the L_C_D_. I would say that it would seem like the general opinion is we're gonna keep the L_C_ display
As for the as for the single curve, well this edge and this edge, like I say it would be nice to have some curvature to it, because it's gonna be flat on one side, I've said single curved. so I mean for the purposes of this meeting maybe we can state that single curve still allows articulation.
just to try and roughly go over what we agreed in the last one, something that looks good 'cause that seems to be in preference to actual functionality in the end, many of our components are gonna be standard, off the shelf, but it seemed like we were gonna require at least an advanced chip and we were still very much for the idea of using an L_C_D_ display. other things were we were hoping to use rubber, most likely gonna be double curved, etcetera. due to your hard work, we might as well let the two designers go first, and show us the prototype. Quite how the best way to do this is, I'm not sure, I think if we both step up and outline our ideas. do doing the prototype gave us a bit more insight into the ergonomics of the design. for one thing, it turned out that the only point at which it needs to be articulated for handedness is is h i is down here for the L_E_D_. As it turned out, the whole thing transfers from the right to left hand fairly well from the point of view of operating the function buttons and joystick, You could simply have a slightly ovoid shaped joystick that could then just be turn twisted round, But as you as you see with the with holding it in the left hand, the L_ the L_C_D_ is nowhere useful, so that would need to be articulated if we're going to retain ergonomic design. this design could be done with with plastic casing. Though I would recommend around the grip part here in the middle, having maybe just a rubber grip over that which would allow for a slightly more sort of bio-morphic form, and a bit more ergonomic as well. I I got your note about keeping the cost down. As for the as for the single curve, well this edge and this edge, like I say it would be nice to have some curvature to it, Really the curve that's most needed is the underside and you have the
this design could be done with with plastic casing. is that we might have to go with plastic and some kind of solid design, plastic for some reason incurs no cost,
l let's say that and then we can have our special coloured case and we can make it yellow,
Slight problem we had was that we have an amazing four Euros over budget for what we were hoping to do. most of it stems from the use of the L_C_D_ which I think in the end accounted for about half of our expenditure the only way to get this down was either to ditch the a L_C_D_, at which point we've removed a large part of how we were gonna interface, Or what we did was that we we as in I as I was quickly going over it was altering the actual structure. changing it to plastic and a solid unit with a single curve design would allow us to come back into the proposed costs we've got point two of a Euro left over there. Even then as well, there was no criteria technically defined for a joystick so I've used what I think's appropriate. It blows a lot of our really good ideas kind of slightly to one side, for example the possibility of having a U_S_B_ connection is definitely not viable now.. We've got an advanced chip, we've got the use of the L_C_D_. I really think as m much as it pains me is that we might have to go with plastic and some kind of solid design, possibly meaning that the L_C_D_ wouldn't be in this perfect place. Mm-hmm I suppose o one thing that could be done is h is have it circular Do you have any data on how much different prints cost? I mean can you get the entire thing printed with a design? You now have as much information as I do.. I've said single curved. We really do need it to be that way for the ergonomics of it. plastic for some reason incurs no cost, if I've read this thing correctly, then we can save point five of a Euro here in that it's not per push button. As you can see, the use of an L_C_ display advanced chip and what would determine the scroll wheel here as well I'm very much open to suggestions of where
Basic point have a list of criteria that we need to rate the prototype by. it's a seven s seven seven step kinda evaluation process. seven scale. after we've finished doing all the ratings for each criteria, we average that And the criteria based on Real Reactions' kinda goals and policies, marketing strategies, and also those I put together from the user requirements phase. those are the criteria. And perhaps I could have put 'em a bit better, but you notice a few things that we've totally abandoned, which means that the product will score very badly on some of those points. we have to go through each point. and just give it a a score. how well have we realised the dream of being able to stop remotes from from being lost, or to be able to find them once they are lost. I mean, is the homing thing still the locator, is that still Yeah, that's still part of the design. I mean I don't think anybody could actually stop a remote being lost,. And making it a bright colour helps we still have that noise thing, on a scale of one to seven, how would you guys rate it for finding finding it once it's lost? I'd say number one. just before we go through all of the steps here, well what we'll do is if we can look at the criteria you're gonna evaluate, and then we'll come back to the product evaluation is that Real Reactions has a a goal strategy that all of the products be inspired by material fashion, and clothing fashion. Something I neglected from my initial research That is why fruit and veg being popular in the home and in clothing was important And then we'll come back pretty much promptly to this. And this bit is this one easy to use for visitors or for anybody? I guess it's just the same as saying easy to use interface, And we can come back to it, you said. Slight problem we had was that we have an amazing four Euros over budget
Ability to stop remotes from being lost or to find them once they are lost. Three. I think we can do three. Reduce the number of unused buttons. I'd say we're doing well there. Easy to use interface, buttons menu, menus we're not doing so badly. easy to use let's forget that one. Fancy looking. It doesn't get much fancier. Technologically innovative. we're getting rid of the locator thing. I'd give it a three for this for that. I mean the menus thing is something you don't normally see on on a remote, Materials that people find pleasing. Sponginess is what they really would have wanted, apparently. Plastic, it sucks. Mm-hmm. I'd s I I'd give it a six, to be honest. that's totally thrown everything off balance. Inspired by the latest interior and clothing fashion. I I I would sa I would say give a s give a selection of colours. we went with yellow we went with yellow for the prototype Leopard print would be cool. But by this I think it's more a case of fruit and veg, It would also help keep the the product placement Is this like a banana type colour? it's not shaped like a banana is I I think s I I think this isn't not particularly fruit and veggie.. I mean it's probably more fruit and veg than most other things out there bar fruit and veg,. I'd I'd I don't think fruit and veg is the sole criterion. Is the sole criterion for being fashion fashionable or inspired by current fashions. and we can make it yellow, and that's pretty much banana like. Yeah, I'll go with five.
we'll come back to your evaluation Just to give you an idea, you want to go maybe a bit quickly as well,
most of it stems from the use of the L_C_D_ which I think in the end accounted for about half of our expenditure the only way to get this down was either to ditch the a L_C_D_, at which point we've removed a large part of how we were gonna interface, we've got the use of the L_C_D_.. I think if we remove the the L_C_ display then there was absolutely no point to any of these meetings If we remove the L_C_ display, we could save ourselves I would say that it would seem like the general opinion is we're gonna keep the L_C_ display
was that we have an amazing four Euros over budget for what we were hoping to do. changing it to plastic and a solid unit with a single curve design would allow us to come back into the proposed costs Or what we did was that we we as in I as I was quickly going over it was altering the actual structure. at which point we've removed a large part of how we were gonna interface, the only way to get this down was either to ditch the a L_C_D_, which I think in the end accounted for about half of our expenditure we've got point two of a Euro left over there. Even then as well, there was no criteria technically defined for a joystick so I've used what I think's appropriate. It blows a lot of our really good ideas kind of slightly to one side, for example the possibility of having a U_S_B_ connection is definitely not viable now.. I really think as m much as it pains me is that we might have to go with plastic and some kind of solid design, if I've read this thing correctly, then we can save point five of a Euro here in that it's not per push button. plastic for some reason incurs no cost, this one comes in under price as you can see, what about speakers and transmitters and stuff like that? Have we factored that in? no, we haven't, not That's too expensive If we remove the L_C_ display, we could save ourselves I mean ho how much extra would it be to to keep I mean keep the the articulation? I would say that you're at least gonna take double curved, it can still be single curved,
changing it to plastic and a solid unit with a single curve design would allow us to come back into the proposed costs We really do need it to be that way for the ergonomics of it. I would say that you're at least gonna take double curved, it can still be single curved, Could we could we not get rid of the curvy the curvous the curvaceousness so I mean for the purposes of this meeting maybe we can state that single curve still allows articulation.
The Industrial Designer, is going to be looking more into the working design.
and the other thing you said that thing about robust and water Water resistant. maybe something didn doesn't make your hands sweat lot. Maybe just like a simple thing to have a clip on it, like so you can clip it to your
The Industrial Designer, is going to be looking more into the working design. User Interface Designer. I guess that maybe the working design has also to do with like the physical feat like just the way it looks and the way it w So technical function. What is technical functions exactl What effect should the thing ha should it have, And the M_E_, what does that stand for? M Marketing, right.. So we'll be working on the user requirements,
, I think one thing is that it should be easy to find I mean you always know where your T_V_ is, so just have a call button, so you should have a call button on your television to be able to find your remote control. or even a maybe a vib a vibrating thing. What if it had something like just like a magnet on the back of it I mean j just to have some place to put it besides like a base. But even just a thing to attach it to the w you know if you had a thing, a pretty object attached to the wall. Do you think it needs to be bigger to not lose, or does that not factor in? Hand-sized.
I also think though that it shouldn't have too many buttons, but like, I don't know you, just have like eight thousand buttons and you're like, no, you never use half of them. So. but what if it had like a little screen, so it has less buttons but it still has all the functions. so you can programme like your favourite channels, But, would you have the screen on the thing, or would you have it on the telly transmitting the screen. so I think it should be possible to have some kind of a screen, I mean, we have to remember our budget is twelve point twelve fifty for to actually make the device.
Our selling price goal is twenty five Euro and profit aim is fifty million Euro., and we will hope to sell this internationally. How many should we sell then? well it's the profit so if a profit for each is twelve fifty, that'll do four million.
User Interface Designer. I guess that maybe the working design has also to do with like the physical feat like just the way it looks and the way it w So technical function.
Experience with remote control., I think one thing is that it should be easy to find I mean you always know where your T_V_ is, so just have a call button, so you should have a call button on your television to be able to find your remote control. or even a maybe a vib a vibrating thing. What if it had something like just like a magnet on the back of it I mean j just to have some place to put it besides like a base.

So we'll be working on the user requirements, Marketing, right..
so f here's our agenda for today. we're gonna do some tool training, project plan and discuss then close. So our aim is to produce a remote control that is original, trendy and user friendly. Right. Functional design, conceptual design and detailed design. So throughout our next couple of meetings we'll we'll be covering these things.
so we're gonna try out our white board. So you want us to draw it and then talk about it? Or just draw it? I think both. We ought to decide who starts and all that.
, I'm Abigail Claflin. and I guess we should all get acquainted. So this is our kick off meeting. Hi I'm Chiara, I'm the Marketing Expert. I'm Stephanie and I am the User Interface Designer. I'm Krista and I'm the Industrial Designer.
and then I just wanna mention some new project requirements that came in., teletext is apparently outdated, so due to internet popularity, so that's off the list., also our remote should be used only for television,, and also we need to incorporate our corporate image onto this,
So we need to make some decisions on the remote control functions. so do we wanna go ahead and design this thing with the finder button? It's easy to implement. but I mean speech recognition is really hard to programme, if you consider our budget, to h have speech recognition programmed in every single remote might be a little pricey. and I was thinking, I_R_ is line of sight, so unless the remote is like actually in front of the T_V_ it's not gonna work, so probably like a radio signal like on a on a cell phone. Yeah, so it would be a two part package. Do you still want to build a little thing next to the telly or to p hang on the wall We probably leave that. So then our target age group would be the nineteen to thirty five range, You don't need a light. And like if the if the phone's under the couch, you might not see the light, so Then it can live anywhere. like if you can yeah if you can call it then it's
'Cause that that is something we have to decide, is whether we want to have V_C_R_ capabilities. And and if we're if we're targeting young professionals and teenagers, I mean it's gonna be D_V_D_ type, that's the the technology these days.
, how do I put this So what happens it doesn't work? Could you just plug it back into hers The cable might be a little loose or something. Okay so now I need to press F_ eight, what is it? What's function?
I think still though, it shouldn't be that hard to take like just reduce the number of buttons you know, like 'cause if you just have like one menu button, that works like with a you know, or you can just kind of scroll through the options u that come up on the T_V_. So we definitely want a power button and numbers. That sort of like joystick flat touch thing, yeah. but do you need a screen then, do you have to have a screen then? you can have the number on the telly going like one two three four five once you scroll and then if you actually just want to zap, you can have like a thing like that, and that, and then it can just be plus and minus. Well y you have to you have to like be able to change the function of it to like w right if you're on the channel let's say, then you press on the middle and then if you do that again the volume goes up, and if you do that it goes down. like it could be a cool sort of you know, because it could be circular, you know, or something weird like that, just So but I'm saying like, does it make sense to have like some kind of a button, so like you're if you're on T_V_, like you can switch channels, but then if if you're on D_V_D_ then like the channel bu like the the region of the disc that was for channels is for like switching to different tracks
In order to see what the functional requirements were to be found, a hundred people were tested in a usability laboratory Custome Customers and users don't like the way remote controls look, they don't like the way they feel, they don't think they match their operating behaviour, and an example is what we were talking about, the buttons, they only use ten per cent of the buttons, I don't know what R_S_I_ means. So the most important buttons are those to do with channel selection. yeah so and and people like to zap a lot apparently, Channel selection, teletext, volume, and power. The other ones are the settings, and they're used less than you know zero point eight to zero point five times per hour, and this means that I think we can we could have like a a button for all the settings, about the screen, and speech recognition, some people are more willing than others to actually pay for that. And if we look at the market, f people from well from fifteen to thirty five year old year olds, ninety one to seventy six percent of people in that age range are willing to pay more for this sort of product, while people that are above thirty five years ol years old go from thirty five percent to eight percent, but I think that the people that actually do buy remotes m more are those like teenagers and young professionals and, most likely,
and I think we should design according to these buttons.
This my presentation about the technical functions design and I basically just tried to focus on just what what functions we need and how to make that the best function for the user. And okay so basically I think i like it is really important that we sort of get this done in a user friendly and fashionable way. you know keeping buttons together that like close together that are used in the same way, keeping the number of buttons the leas you know to a minimum, but basically we need to make sure that it turns on and off the T_V_. or do we need to have like functions for cable or V_C_R_? I just thought that these two remotes were pretty boring, And I think we can find something that's more fun to look at and use than either of those. but I mean I think we sh can sort of think about things like like colour and you know size, shapes, that sort of thing, to best fit the user.
Okay so this is on the working design, which is sort of the mechanical functions of the remote, so I think we need two basic functions which is just the basic remote functions, the user can input a channel or volume setting and it will be output to the T_V_. And also we talked about a location function where maybe you could press a button on the T_V_ and it would send sort of signal to the remote where it would beep or flash or vibrate or whatever to tell you where the remote is. So the components we need are an energy source to power the remote, processor to take the information, and we also need something on the remote that would receive the location signal and have an output, like possibly a beep or a vibration. so my personal preferences for how to build the remote would probably be, battery for the energy source, a button pad for input, I_R_ transmitter to communicate to the T_V_, and I'd probably say a buzzer for the location function on the remote itself.
So then our target age group would be the nineteen to thirty five range,
Do you still want to build a little thing next to the telly or to p hang on the wall We probably leave that.
like if you can yeah if you can call it then it's Then it can live anywhere.
You don't need a light. And like if the if the phone's under the couch, you might not see the light, so
You know actually our our new project requirements, I'm not sure if they meant o onl use only for television as in not for D_V_D_ or just not internet type things. So I'll I'll check that and update you on the next
so everyone's gonna go finish their questionnaire,
then when we come back after lunch we'll have thirty minutes of individual work, yeah, so think about the things we've discussed and bring some new ideas to our next meeting.
It's easy to implement. so do we wanna go ahead and design this thing with the finder button? so probably like a radio signal like on a on a cell phone. Yeah, so it would be a two part package.
if you consider our budget, to h have speech recognition programmed in every single remote might be a little pricey.
So we definitely want a power button and numbers.
like it could be a cool sort of you know, because it could be circular, you know, or something weird like that, just That sort of like joystick flat touch thing, yeah.
But the only thing is like, iPods are so expensive, I don't think it's the wheel dealy. so everyone's gonna go finish their questionnaire, then when we come back after lunch we'll have thirty minutes of individual work, yeah, so think about the things we've discussed and bring some new ideas to our next meeting.
But what if we ha what if we had like a spongy sort of like stress balley kinda
And you're gonna be doing protu product evaluation.
You could do like the computers where they have like the grapefruit, apple machine and they have like the blueberry, like all the colours are named after fruits.
, I'll just review what we did in our last meeting., under marketing we targeted our audience,, then we considered some design options with how it should look,
, can I do next? 'Cause I have to say something about the material and the findings are that the first thing to aim for is a fashion, fancy look and feel.. Next comes technologic technology and the innovations to do with that. And th last thing is the easy to use factor., our fashion-watchers in Milan and Paris have decided, well noticed, that f the fruit and vegetable theme is the is the current trend So we want to put the fashion electronics, we need to go fruit and vegetables. And also go for a spongy feel, I don't know how spongy can be achieved but apparently that's the way to go.. I I have been thinking about this fruit and vegetable thing and I prefer fruits to vegetables, should we print the fruit stuff, or should the actual remote look like a fruit?

I I have been thinking about this fruit and vegetable thing and I prefer fruits to vegetables, should we print the fruit stuff, or should the actual remote look like a fruit?
I think the batteries would have to go right under the plastic case. we actually had an option of batteries, solar power, and a dynamo, Oh, a dynamo is, it's a bicycle. It's a bicycle mechanism. Yeah, the other one was the other one was a kinetic thing where you'd basically have to wind it yourself. So I sort of picked battery. No. But dynamo the the fact with dynamo is, the moment you move it, it c it creates energy on its own. So if you throw it, it's gonna store loads of energy, and you don't need to buy a battery 'cause they're quite f I find them annoying. But we need to find cost. Like the chip is probably the most expensive part.
So I've been looking at the components design., so we need some custom design parts, and other parts we'll just use standard., I assume we'll be custom designing our case, And we'll need to custom desi design a circuit board,, standard parts include the buttons and the wheels, the iPod-style wheel. And al we also need a beeper or buzzer or other sort of noise thing for locating the remote., I'd recommend against titanium, and the rubber case requires rubber buttons, so if we definitely want plastic buttons, we shouldn't have a rubber case., well we can use wood. I don't know why we'd want to.
, and working on the look and feel of the design and user interface design.
, we can use rubber, plastic, wood or titanium. and also we should note that if we want an iPod-style wheel button, it's gonna require a m qu slightly more expensive chip.
Oh when we move on, you two are going to be playing with play-dough.
I can see like some kind of a thing where like you sort of have like the number come up on the T_V_ like what channel you're on. that, like, then you hit that and then you can it brings up like the menu on the T_V_ But also if you have it on the screen you can actually write everything out,
I mean, if you're thinking of the design of it now, like the a you know, physical attributes, I mean are you you gonna have any buttons on that besides power and this thing? So can we imagine that this would be smaller than the remote controls that you showed us before. Like, I think we're looking at something that could be, like like even maybe like a cir I'm f I'm seeing almost like a circular sort of like handheld like thing. W when we had the wheely remote control, we it was on the top I think, if you held it like that. What if,, you had like a b a cover that went over buttons that you don't use very much? you could just have covers and then your mobile f it's like a mobile phone thing. and then there's more of a hard plastic thing where that thing is. And on that hard plastic thing you can change either the colour or the fruit or vegetable that's on there. Because I was thinking if you have a cover for the squashy bit, oh so so you're saying the squishy part's like detachable, so so maybe one you know you can have like the broccoli squishy thing, and then you could have like the banana squishy thing
If you have like that stress ball material kind of as what you're actually holding in your hand, and then there's more of a hard plastic thing where that thing is. And on that hard plastic thing you can change either the colour or the fruit or vegetable that's on there. see you're thinking, it's weird, you're thinking the opposite of me Because I was thinking if you have a cover for the squashy bit, oh so so you're saying the squishy part's like detachable, so so maybe one you know you can have like the broccoli squishy thing, and then you could have like the banana squishy thing
And then there's also the concern about you know how do you get to the menu if you wanna change the brightness of your television, So I guess we have to look into the,, like, the programming, how this how they actually programme these things, and if that's Oh how they make the menu show up on the T_V_? I believe it's ins it's gotta be inside the T_V_, not inside the remote.
oh so so you're saying the squishy part's like detachable, And on that hard plastic thing you can change either the colour or the fruit or vegetable that's on there.
we're gonna try to talk about, what kind of how people are actually going to be using this iPod-ish remote control, based on fruit vegetable design. And,, basically, so, this is a touched ba a touch-based graphical interface system., so people are going to be looking at this little screen. I mean I assume, are we still on the screen idea? it seems like you would need a screen. But the screen can come up on the telly, the she said. Okay so if we're not gonna have a screen I think So basically it's just gonna be a wheel then? I guess that's wh why I was thinking you may need to have some kind of a screen So that people can go arou go back and forth and choose if I can see like some kind of a thing where like you sort of have like the number come up on the T_V_ like what channel you're on. I mean so you basically just kinda need to figure out like what kind of, you know, range we need to have on the wheel, You have to get a an advanced chip if you wanna have a screen in, which is more expensive than the regular chip, which is more expensive than the minimal. that, like, then you hit that and then you can it brings up like the menu on the T_V_ Yeah, well we don't want the screen I guess,
But what if we ha what if we had like a spongy sort of like stress balley kinda If you have like that stress ball material kind of as what you're actually holding in your hand, Because I was thinking if you have a cover for the squashy bit, oh so so you're saying the squishy part's like detachable, so so maybe one you know you can have like the broccoli squishy thing, and then you could have like the banana squishy thing
I mean I assume, are we still on the screen idea? it seems like you would need a screen. But the screen can come up on the telly, the she said. Okay so if we're not gonna have a screen I think So basically it's just gonna be a wheel then? I guess that's wh why I was thinking you may need to have some kind of a screen So that people can go arou go back and forth and choose if And then there's also the concern about you know how do you get to the menu if you wanna change the brightness of your television, You have to get a an advanced chip if you wanna have a screen in, which is more expensive than the regular chip, which is more expensive than the minimal. Yeah, well we don't want the screen I guess,
You could do like the computers where they have like the grapefruit, apple machine and they have like the blueberry, like all the colours are named after fruits. And on that hard plastic thing you can change either the colour or the fruit or vegetable that's on there. so so maybe one you know you can have like the broccoli squishy thing, and then you could have like the banana squishy thing So where are the fruit and vegetables now? I guess they would be either in the colour of that plastic face on the front, or in the colour of the squishy thing underneath.
But we need to find cost. Does anyone have costs on the on the web? All it said was it gave sort of relative, some chips are more expensive than others, sort of things. It didn't give me any actual cost.
What if we just smash all the vegetables down flat? 'cause some of these are not as easy to hold. I I personally don't think this is comfortable to to sit there, like it's an awkward position. although the broccoli is quite comfortable, I have to say,
Okay we have to fill in all this stuff. So I guess we're supposed to write final reports.
So I guess we're supposed to write final reports. All of us? I don't know... Or is that just me?
and the means for like the materials we used, how convenient were they? Well I'm not a big fan of any Microsoft, PowerPoint or any of this stuff. but l but I di I thought that my the information that was available to me was kind of just like it was kinda like okay, I don't really think I dunno what I'm doing here. and I didn't really like the PowerPoint presentations, My first bit of information was like this child's drawn picture of how a remote works. 'Cause my problem was, you guys had access to like they'd put send you to sites and stuff Yeah well mine was mostly made up But it must have been quite difficult for them to build a whole
The prototype making was very creatively stimulating It was a very democratic process and everyone got to contribute. yeah, I thought we all worked very well together.
I guess we're supposed to discuss the prod the process of the project and how satisfied Did you feel there was a lot of room for creativity in the sort of I felt like I was off-task all the time. What do you guys think of the pens? They're kinda hard to write with though.
but l but I di I thought that my the information that was available to me was kind of just like it was kinda like okay, I don't really think I dunno what I'm doing here. and I didn't really like the PowerPoint presentations, My first bit of information was like this child's drawn picture of how a remote works. 'Cause my problem was, you guys had access to like they'd put send you to sites and stuff Yeah well mine was mostly made up But it must have been quite difficult for them to build a whole
So our design looks something like this. This being the wheel that you use to change channels or volume or whatever. And the base of the remote control, which has a squishy spongy rubbery feel, is interchangeable. So you can change the colour, according to your to suit your living room or whatever. You could change the vegetable, or fruit. it's trendy fruit, it's not just ordinary fruits. And then people will be encouraged to buy three or five of them, because they'll need to switch 'em out. It's been a little bit difficult to make sure that it's hand-holdable,
Last time we discussed the squishy fruitiness of our remote controls and how we might pursue that. and we also talked about materials we'd use and what kind of chip would be necessary.
Well I'm not a big fan of any Microsoft, PowerPoint or any of this stuff.
What if we just smash all the vegetables down flat? 'cause some of these are not as easy to hold. I I personally don't think this is comfortable to to sit there, like it's an awkward position. although the broccoli is quite comfortable, I have to say,
and I think we've come up with a product that's fun and meets all the criteria. 'Cause I mean we've all we all kind of agreed our product is satisfactory, it fits the budget, and it's trendy.
we we chose the shape or the sh shape could be whatever we wanted and then it would just be like a design on the rubber. and just have the colour match or something. We could make it that shape but just have different colours, and call 'em the different fruits. And you could like if it's like this, you could put fruit designs and stuff on that part. I bet having different colours is a lot cheaper than having different shapes too.

What if we just smash all the vegetables down flat? 'cause some of these are not as easy to hold. I I personally don't think this is comfortable to to sit there, like it's an awkward position. although the broccoli is quite comfortable, I have to say,
I think we should look at the ones that like where s where people said four, where it looks like we might wanna discuss changing an aspect of the remote. Well the worst ones were three point one. Material technologically innovative, Batteries easy to insert for some reason, I think that's not a problem any more. You could make the touch pad in th in different shapes, It might also sort of annoy people if we get used to having the buttons in one shape.
And the cri well basically the findings are the same as the evaluation criteria. I think if each of us gives an opinion then they can be mixed somehow. we can do it separately and then discuss it We'll just go in a circle. Okay so do we just add it up and divide it by four? So it's a one was true and seven was false? Oh I thought it was the other way round. I thought it was the other way round too.
Right what happens is we have to decide whether this this whole this whole project we've been working on actually meets the standards we were set at the start. And we we have therefore in total We have five we have eleven points according to which this should be evaluated. True is one and and false is seven. I think if each of us gives an opinion then they can be mixed somehow. it's if it's fancy you put one, if it's really unfancy it's seven. Apparently I'm supposed to use the whiteboard. is it necessary? I don't think so. We'll just go in a circle. Okay so do we just add it up and divide it by four? I'm I'm sorry this was so tedious for everyone.
if you wanna look in your project documents folder, there's an Excel spreadsheet. the only one that's in there, production costs. But if I missed anything that we've gone over, or if you see something that has changed I said uncurved or flat. My impression was that flat meant like like one of those square remotes. There's plastic for that area around the button. and lots of special colours actually. Okay so that would make our total of eleven point nine, which is even less than twelve point five, which means we'd be making even more of a profit.
Well the locator is just chip that's inside there. And the beeper's also inside there too somewhere So you have to have a button on your on your you have to attach the button to the Yeah we have that that has yes yet to be designed. Yeah that c hey that that could you know match the handset.
So thanks for coming for the meeting first of all, and we have a long time, just twenty-five minutes to discuss about this project and the the project initiation. First of all I want to ask Mister Ed about your marketing plan and your product plan and Well I think that we'll see that throughout the day in how we're going to put this together as a marketing to to market the product. We'll have to see on a through discussion on where we're gonna go from here and from with this. but do you already have like a functional design or a technical design or for the moment not yet. do you have some project plan, something with you or this is like I said that we have to be discussed between all of us and we'll go from there. We'll have to simply we'll have to work on it together. so by when you think you can give me some kind of project plan, okay, Certainly by the next meeting. so there's any questions or first of all about this project?
good morning everybody here. And I want to introduce myself, my name is Shrida Daseri and I'm a project manager for this new project which we are going to discuss now. So I want to introduce first of all the names and the colleagues here. my name is Agnes and I'm an user usability user interface designer. My name is Ed and I do accounting. Do you also do marketing? So only accounting? And I'm Christine, and my role in this scenario is to be the industrial designer. So who is marketing, nobody in the market Marketing is, is me.
Yes, so what I prefer maybe you need to interact more with the Christine, okay, because you know what she is going to do it, okay, but you are the core because you are in the marketing, okay, So, what I prefer, okay, so you need to interact with the Christine more and within her team, okay, who is using the functional design or technical design, okay, and you need to come up with some kind of plan, okay, how we are going to do the your sales plan, okay, Do we already have a cost limit on this, th an idea of how much we want to market this for, how much it's gonna sell for, that's up that's up to us to decide,? Yes, that's you have to decide, okay, so the best thing is you both of the Christine and you discuss with yourself, okay, and come up with the cost, and how we are going to compete in the market, okay, in the the technically, or in the sales wise, okay, the commercial wise, okay. Then we have to design, okay, how long it will take the whole project, okay, how much is going to cost us, and how much we are going to benefit for the company. Okay, so I think it's maybe if we can give me some kind of your the sales plan, okay, including the technical what she's going to talk to you within the team, okay, then it will help me to discuss with the management for further, okay, and put it in the the proper project plan. Okay, and if you need any coordination in between compared to the maybe the some technical vendors or commercial vendors, okay, depends if you want to have some marketing plan or technical plan, okay, so you let me know. or maybe, you are my coordinator, am I right? I mean my job from what I understood was to look at the usability requirements and make sure that the product is usable, it's acceptable to the people who are gonna use it and look at
Would you mind at the conclusion of our meeting could could you send us a copy of your slides? Yes, I will. Yes.
Well not yet other than doing research and taking remote controls and looking what other companies have to do, what they're building, their designs, their ideas, also have to pinpoint which market we're gonna go into. It should be a fairly large market because the number of people that the competition, th I agree it has to be something it has to be something new, Whether it works or not, they have to first say I like this, I like the design, and then it's gotta be simple to use.
and first of all with your user acceptance, okay, how it looks like and how it's going to be work in the market, okay, I mean my job from what I understood was to look at the usability requirements and make sure that the product is usable, it's acceptable to the people who are gonna use it and look at the best ways to do that.
Christine, what about your the industrial design plan? Are you have a design already on this product or you're still working on the design? no, I I have not begun working on the design, I actually didn't know we were designing a remote control, the website I went to look at had some announcements about an introduction of a some sort of a seven inch monitor, and I understood that that was the project goal. I just did s see that we were starting a new project together and there was going to be a four member team composed of these people, So you'll be leading the team for your design team or how many members is working in the team, for the design? well, I would th think that depends on how much money you give us. because, you know, you can you can make it you have different choices with different financial models. Yeah, but before we talk about the finance, okay, do you have some idea how we can sell this product or project in the market and how much is going to benefit to the company and of course it's to the individual also. I kind of think that in general you have to do y you have to have something that's very fashionable, that's very attractive that people see and recognize its goal, and they immediately wanna have it have one of their own. So it would really would need to you know, I don't care what it does, just so it looks cool. but when you think you can give me like a kind of design on the functional design or the technical design? Well, I've got a lot of other projects I'm doing right now If they go quickly then it could be a month. If if I run into any problems in my other projects it might be six months. so like what's your functional design, what's your technical design, and how many people you need for this project, and what's the time frame you're looking, okay, and what is the budget, maybe
What is the goal of the project? the goal of the project I think maybe I'll hand out to the Ed, okay, so to explain what is the project because he's in the sales and the accounting. so can you explain what exactly the product is? From what I had in mind we're supposed to be marketing coffee, Oh I think, if I'm not wrong, we're making the remote control. 'cause I had two different things. I had a first part of mine was to make a remote control for a new f remote control for television, and afterward I had a discussion about coffee so we'll start with the remote control for television then. So we're have to design something that is very user friendly. Something visual that has something that will will draw people to buy the product, because I think everybody's experienced with remote controls, we're have to come up with a new idea on how to make it a lot easier to use, 'cause a lot of times spend half a day through the instruction book trying to figure out how to use it.
To come up with the functional design and to discuss with Ed, okay, and how it's going to be work,
Well not yet other than doing research and taking remote controls and looking what other companies have to do, what they're building, their designs, their ideas, no, I I have not begun working on the design, I actually didn't know we were designing a remote control, the website I went to look at had some announcements about an introduction of a some sort of a seven inch monitor, and I understood that that was the project goal. I just did s see that we were starting a new project together
So, the immediate next step is to start determining the functional design, or
Okay, so I think it's maybe if we can give me some kind of your the sales plan, okay, including the technical what she's going to talk to you within the team, okay, then it will help me to discuss with the management for further, okay, and put it in the the proper project plan. and how we are going to compete in the market, okay, in the the technically, or in the sales wise, okay, the commercial wise, okay.
So, the immediate next step is to start determining the functional design, or To come up with the functional design and to discuss with Ed, okay, and how it's going to be work, and first of all with your user acceptance, okay, how it looks like and how it's going to be work in the market, okay, so then we can discuss about further things. Would you mind at the conclusion of our meeting could could you send us a copy of your slides? Yes, I will. Yes. And if anything you need anytime so please either you can call me, or just send me email, or just come and knock my door, okay,
so then we can discuss about further things.
from the marketing yeah, from the marketing side, just to to give an idea what the management is looking for, I was looking for a a remote control to have a s I have a sales price of twenty-five Euro, with a production price of twelve and a half Euro. For what I think from what we're trying to find, we're tr we're looking for, I don't think that price is exactly in the market. in the recent surveys, from the ages fr from fifteen to thirty-five, eighty percent are willing to spend more money for something as fancy as trendy. Twenty-five Euros, that's that's a preson reasonable price. Now if we're gonna take a risk, and push this up a bit, make it more expensive, then it w it could possibly sell. But, I think there's one other thing interesting two things that are interesting is that from the fifteen to thirty-five year-old group, which always spends more money on trendy new things, speech recognition is requested. And we're talking between seventy-five to ninety percent of this group is willing to pay for speech recognition on a remote. Obviously, we can't make a remote into a computer, but maybe simple commands. louder, softer, on, off. Thirty-five percent say they're too difficult to use. So we have to figure out a way of making it more user friendly. fifty percent say they can't find the remote half the time. So maybe one word speech recognition commands, say remote, and there's a beep beep beep, But, in the cost that the management is looking for, that's not gonna be possible. But if it's trendy, if it's fancy, it's got some colour to it, if it's very easy easy to use, if it's got simple remote speech remote control, like I said, louder, softer, change channel, on, off, remote, it goes beep beep, So we're gonna have to look at it in a in this global idea, with the ideas of the industrial design. But, price obviously we have to talk about. What do you think about the design, what he was talking
what I can suggest to you, Christine, if you need some the technical feedback, or some training, okay, about this facility, especially for the speech recognition, I can recommend you some companies like Intel or I_B_M_, because they're already in this speech recognition part, and if you want, I can coordinate, okay, to get some information, and you can let me know, okay, so what kind of the details you require okay, to add this feature in this project. we need to know how much is the timeframe you need to develop, apart from what today.
From from your side, you're gonna have to go back the management and s be more s precise. What do they want?, a risk, take a risk on the market? Something that's gonna cost more, but could very easily s make a boom in the market? Because it has to be something totally different, but end of the day, you're the sales guy, It's of course it's good to tell the management how much it's cost us I don't mind to convince, okay, the management to spend some more money on the project, okay, if you can make out of The management says, okay, so they they don't want certain facilities, they want something new, I think like speech recognit definitely they will agree, And I hope I can convince the management on that,
the method that we usually use in the user interface design is that we need to look at what people like and what people don't like about existing products. So, in our case, existing remote controls. We seem to have intuitions about why things are good or things are bad, but when you look, technically, at how it works, sometimes that's not the case. Then we need to decide what functionalities we really want to keep, and then what the remote control should look like, in terms of the functionalities that we need, you obviously need to be able to turn the T_V_ on and off. You need to change channels, both by directly going to a specific channel or by channel surfing. You need to be able to control the volume and then control any menus on the T_V_ to regulate contrast or whatever. the problems that people have expressed is that there's too many buttons on remote controls, in general. The buttons it's not clear what they're supposed to do. often, you need to know specific button sequences to get certain functionalities done, which you don't necessarily always remember, especially if it's a functionality that you don't use very often. here we've got two examples where here on the left-hand side, you can see a remote control that has lots and lots of buttons. The buttons, in a lot of cases, are tiny. they're labelled, but the labels don't necessarily tell you too much. Whereas, on the other side, you have a much simpler remote control that I think basically has the minimum functionalities that are needed. And it sort of looks simpler and just less imposing when you first look at it. So, I would be inclined to go sort of towards this, in terms of design, rather than this. And if there's specific functionalities that require more buttons, then we can figure out how to do it with existing buttons. So my personal preferences are to keep the number of buttons to a limit, or to a minimum, make frequently used buttons bigger and more strategically placed
Should we maybe make a decision about what features we actually want to include, 'cause we've thrown a lot of features onto the table, do we actually want to incorporate all of them, or have we missed anything? Do you wanna go back and look at the closing slide, maybe that would provide some guidance? I think we should do as many features as start with all of them right now I was just thinking is it really practical to start designing something with features that we're just gonna end up throwing away? I mean, it takes a lot of time and effort for everyone to consider different features, and s if we spend that time and effort on features that we're not gonna use, maybe it's better to spend it on the f thinking more about features that we actually do want, I think we should take that as an action item for after the meeting, 'cause w our meeting time has run out.
Should we maybe make a decision about what features we actually want to include, I think we should do as many features as start with all of them right now and eliminate them later in the process, do we actually want to incorporate all of them, or have we missed anything? I was just thinking is it really practical to start designing something with features that we're just gonna end up throwing away? I mean, it takes a lot of time and effort for everyone to consider different features, and s if we spend that time and effort on features that we're not gonna use, maybe it's better to spend it on the f thinking more about features that we actually do want, I think we should take that as an action item for after the meeting,
and it will be slim, 'Cause, for example, in the unbreakable thing, doing something plastic would be harder, if you can add other facility, other feature, like unbreakable. if it's got simple remote speech remote control, like I said, louder, softer, change channel, on, off, remote, it goes beep beep, I can find my my remote without spending half a day looking for it and getting all upset and to keep the design basically sleek and simple. So maybe one word speech recognition commands, say remote, and there's a beep beep beep,
it says individual actions, and specific instructions will be sent by our our coach. and you're supposed to keep watching the trends. supposed to work on the user interface concept, so I'm supposed to do the components concept, and eliminate them later in the process,
From from your side, you're gonna have to go back the management and s be more s precise. What do they want? The management says, okay, so they they don't want certain facilities, I think like speech recognit definitely they will agree, And I hope I can convince the management on that,
and you're supposed to keep watching the trends.
supposed to work on the user interface concept,
and eliminate them later in the process, I think we should do as many features as start with all of them right now I think we should take that as an action item for after the meeting, 'cause w our meeting time has run out.
and if you want, I can coordinate, okay, to get some information, if you need some the technical feedback, or some training, okay, about this facility, especially for the speech recognition, I can recommend you some companies like Intel or I_B_M_,
so I'm supposed to do the components concept,
management come with the new proposal, and I have to discuss a few points on this. both says new insights in the aim of your project. the one is the teletext becomes outmoded, okay because if because of the computer systems and the new technology. we don't need to consider really about the teletext all in our new project design. And the second one is about the remote control. Should be used only for the T_V_. And the third point, it's very very important to establish our marketing or corporate image, okay, with this new project or new product.
I'll invite Christine to discuss about the functional design. I I figured we should identify some user requirements, and from my experience, I wanna, and from research I did, the the device has to turn the television on and off the first time you press on the big button, Because one of the biggest problems with remote controls is finding them. since we have to establish our corporate image on the basis of this new product, thought we better look at things that are popular and ex go beyond those, and then we might wanna talk eventually about the materials that are appropriate to use in in the construction, especially in the the the outside of the product I did a little history on the the remote controls all these devices are examples of where they represent examples that are available today which I think the one in the middle is r really something to keep in mind. you could throw it at things if if the T_V_ didn't turn on and off, you could use it for something else. But I just took some different schematics and I guess this is what a slide might look like if you were drawing a circuit board. personal preferences, I I'm really thinking outside the box here, and I think that we should consider perhaps having an an an a a size a remote control that changes in size depending on the user preference. So something that's very very flexible and inflatable I think it could either be you could go either one extreme, be very colourful, or you could make it clear, and kind of blend in with things, I think it needs to be waterproof, because sometimes they fall into cups one of my requirements was about needs t to tell you when it's done its job or not, because half the time, I keep pushing on the remote control, and I don't know if it's actually understood my message, so I think it should give you some sort of an oral cue. And, course I never wanna replace the battery
if you can add other facility, other feature, like unbreakable. because especially today, you know, you have the family and the kids, and the kids throw it if you can add the feature, okay, for your fabric whatever in your outline design okay, with unbreakable, I think that will give a lot of advantage for our product, Do you have any preconceived ideas in terms of materials? 'Cause, for example, in the unbreakable thing, doing something plastic would be harder, whereas having something like, I dunno, steel or titanium isn't really economically viable. Titanium would be be heavy, too, I wanted feedback, but we'll see what your personal preferences are and your thoughts. I like titanium. Expensive. It'd be hard to inflate something ou made out of titanium though.
Do you wanna take an action item to go find out? Once we get a price on it then we can market it. Then meantime you can come up with the price, how much it's cost as extra for the display. An and the marketing strategy, that's very important, okay.
maybe what you can do is, both of you, you can come up with the the prototype, okay, the model. Then meantime you can come up with the price, how much it's cost as extra for the display. An and the marketing strategy, that's very important, okay. So, by next meeting, so, please come up with the the prototype, okay, then, then we can proceed from there.
maybe what you can do is, both of you, you can come up with the the prototype, okay, the model. So, by next meeting, so, please come up with the the prototype, okay,
You know, maybe what you could do is when somebody orders the device id you could send them like a b some sort of a foam rubber ball, and then they would squeeze it, and it would take the shape of their hand. But th for that you'd also have to do sort of an average across families and things like that if unless everyone has their own personal remote. Well, already the customisability is a really good sort of new gimmick. it was Nokia that came out with this changeable colours. Right, you take it apart, and put on another face, take it off and put on another face and then they sold millions, millions. We'd also have to wor consider that who we were gonna get to make these custom cases in terms of manufacturing processes, we might wanna learn about labour laws. You know in different countries and stuff wher so we can do it cheap, but you don't wanna exploit labour in third world countries. So actually you could turn it y turn around and say that you're par the reason the cost is high for the device is because you're paying a a working wage to the person who made the device. Yeah, but we can get a production in,, countries like,, India We're here to design, come up with a nice product. but that that we can that we can talk about the production later, okay, depends on the the quantity, okay. So we don't need to have our own fabric factory or something, but le let's decide first about the components concept and interface concept, okay,
And your design whether you want with the display or without display or just a simple, so I mean I think it's a good idea, but we need to really think about how useful it's gonna be So, if we're trying to keep costs down, then maybe sacrificing the display is a way to go. because theoretically with the T_V_ you already have a big display right in front of you. I mean it depends on how much putting a display costs and what it would be used for do you know how much it costs,, to to add a little display like this? Do you wanna take an action item to go find out? Once we get a price on it then we can market it. what we'll do is,, we will stick with the the simple design for time being until th Ed find outs about the how much it's cost to the extra, in case we go for the display.
Why was the plastic eliminated as a possible material? so then we were thinking about rubber, but unfortunately that's been eliminated because of the heat factor and then th plastic also has this problem of melting and it's brittle it gets brittle after a while, but unfortunately titanium's also been eliminated, nevertheless they've eliminated all of our options except wood.
I mean it depends on how much putting a display costs and what it would be used for do you know how much it costs,, to to add a little display like this? Do you wanna take an action item to go find out?
So, it's a very short presentation, 'cause I'm actually gonna draw you the layout on the board I took the ideas that we were talking about last time and tried to put that into the remote control so the things that y you can actually see on it are the on off switch, volume and channel control, the menu access button, ergonomic shape, which I completely agree with Christine's idea to have it sort of molded, so it's slightly more ergonomic and comfortable to hold than the r standard very straight remote controls. And actually the other thing with the wood if we take your customising idea, is that people can actually do sort of quasi-measurements on their hand size, so if someone has larger hands, you have a wider remote control. So, that's actually a really good idea for customi customisability., one thing I thought might be kind of interesting is to put a flip screen on it, just like you have on flip phones, so that you don't have this case where someone sits on the remote control or accidentally puts their hand on it, especially if you have little kids around, they're not pressing the buttons while you're trying to watch a T_V_ show and accidentally change the channel or turn it off. And also you had issues with the batteries running out, so I thought maybe we could put a little battery life-light on it that kind of goes dimmer and dimmer and dimmer as your battery is starts to die. And in terms of invisible features, audio and tactile feedback on button presses and, like you said, speech recognition. You'd have something like this with an on-off switch fairly big, sort of in the corner and by itself, so you don't accidentally turn your T_V_ off while you're trying to manoeuvre other buttons. And then you have sort of one of those toggle displays for, oops, channels and volume, sort of for surfing channels and then volume, so the volume would be the up and down, 'cause volume goes up and down and then channels left
I mean I think it's a good idea, So, if we're trying to keep costs down, then maybe sacrificing the display is a way to go. but we need to really think about how useful it's gonna be I mean it depends on how much putting a display costs and what it would be used for Do you wanna take an action item to go find out? Once we get a price on it then we can market it.
I also have a f very simple presentation, because for the marketing point you have to see what the consumers want. I also have copied a different type of remote. We've been giving simple questionnaires in different areas because th obviously we have to see what the com consumers are looking for today, 'cause trends change very very quickly. Looking for next generation of innovation, fancy and feel-good, that's what we've been looking for, something that feels good in the hand, that's easy to use. Easy to use, has always has become has become another major interest that, And I think this is another thing that's interesting is the consumers actually willing to pay the price for exciting tel technology. The second two, you can see the last one is a very easy simple design. The second one, there is about forty-five thousand different buttons on it, which makes it fairly hard to read, very hard to use. The first one, I see that they put in a display. Now there's something else with the little flip-up, now we're adding all kinds of things in, but with the little flip-up, if you have a little display on the flip-up that when you close it everything is locked. Maybe the display also makes it easier to use, So maybe if we can incorporate the easiness of use, trendy, fancy, feels good, with a display, wood, designer wood, designer colours Context-sensitive instructions, depending on what the tel what mode the T_V_ or the D_V_D_ or something else is in. Especially you might need something like that for training the speech recognition and
We'd also have to wor consider that who we were gonna get to make these custom cases in terms of manufacturing processes, Yeah, but we can get a production in,, countries like,, India but you don't wanna exploit labour in third world countries.
we were looking he specifically at the components the following components, the case, the power supply, the means of communications with the television set. In instance we had talked about using some sort of speech recognition, you have to have microphone well no you don't actually I haven't have to have microphone in the device, it has to it has to hear the speaker so it could be in the television set, could be in the device, and a w a way of making beeps or sounds so you can find it when it's gets lost. Our method for going about this is we've looked at the histo hi historical record, what's worked, what hasn't and then we also we wanted to evaluate some new materials and we contacted manufacturing for their input because, course, we m might come up and choose the material that then manufacturing didn't have the technologies or capabilities to offer us, So for the case, we told we were making a specifica specific assumption that it would be curved in design. Course, you know, I wanted it to be expandable and shrinkable, but that doesn't seem to b be one of the choic non-option we can we can really seriously explore, so then we were thinking about rubber, but unfortunately that's been eliminated because of the heat factor and th there might be some problems with the m how it's goes with the board. and then th plastic also has this problem of melting and it's brittle it gets brittle after a while, so we still had titanium and and wood available, but unfortunately titanium's also been eliminated, the m people in manufacturing said that you couldn't make d curved cases out of titanium, So then there's this other matter of the chips and well we could use a simple design on the board, these simple chips, but that's only works for the bu you don't get very much intelligence with this simple one. And then there was the regular which I regret that I've forgotten exactly why I'm eliminating that one. the other option was
but le let's decide first about the components concept and interface concept, okay, A customisable and and I think we've kinda come to some agreement regarding this concept of a wooden case. So the the advanced chip on print is what what we've we've deci we've determined
nevertheless they've eliminated all of our options except wood. I I'd really think we should, you know, use some of some really exotic woods, like, you know, well you guys come from tropical countries so you can kinda think of some trees and some nice woods. I think that people will might really want to design their own cases, and then they could submit their orders, kinda like you submit a custom car order, you know, and my recommendations for the new remote control w would be to have have it be made out of wood. Why was the plastic eliminated as a possible material? Because it gets brittle, cracks we expect these these remote controls to be around for several hundred years. I think with wood though you'd run into the same types of problems, I mean it chips, it if you drop it, So so you're not convinced about the the wood, yes. I think if you re if you use really good quality wood, then it might work, the o the only w the only wood you can use are the ones that are hard, extremely hard wood, Well, it's actually a very innovative n different idea that you know you can choose your colour of wood, your type of wood. One thing we'd have to check though is what the users whether how quickly the novelty wears off of having you wouldn't wanna have to have splinters in your hand while you're using your have to see how kid-friendly it is and and all that,
I think that people will might really want to design their own cases, you know, well you guys come from tropical countries so you can kinda think of some trees and some nice woods. and then they could submit their orders, kinda like you submit a custom car order, you know, Well, already the customisability is a really good sort of new gimmick. So the the advanced chip on print is what what we've we've deci we've determined and I think we've kinda come to some agreement regarding this concept of a wooden case. A customisable and I think they could be rubber like they are now, What about the buttons, would Would the buttons be wood too, or
I would like to explore the possibility of using alternative delivery and sales channel which would be to use the internet for promotion and ordering and then to drop-ship the p product to the customer's residence. You can do a shipping centre somewhere, or strategically place shipping centres to minimise distance costs. In fact, we should sell through Amazon, Or eBay, yeah. That actually makes more sense if we're gonna make it so highly customisable, 'cause on the web people can look at the different options they have, see maybe what other people have done, what the range of possibility as, And you can even have an a movie that you can rotate the object and look at the di the only thing that you're missing really is the weight. The weight and feel. but people are getting used to buying things online that they can't touch before buying. maybe there's a possibility of selling more than two million units in one year, which could you know, feasibili feasibility lower the price of the unit. I don't think that's not possible,
Well I was just wondering about if we're gonna do a product evaluation then what about time for redesign if the users come back and tell us no this is bad, this is bad, we want this done differently. Let's proceed with this model, okay, for the for the marketing direction, okay. So no more changes will be made, okay, in this the basic design. So we will introduce m this model and let's introduce in the market and let's take the feedback from the customers, then we can go for the second generation. The problem is there might not be a second generation if the first generation flops for some silly reason that we haven't thought of. Well, every customer, okay, they have their own ideas, they have their own test, okay, so there's no end, there's no limit. No, but there's a difference between releasing a product that has been minimally tested and fine-tuned to suit a general range of requirements versus releasing a product that we think will work but we don't really have anything to back it up. I mean the whole point of user evaluation is to see what real people need. well you have no redesign not you personally, but in the project we have no redesign time and A lot of products have gone out there without being properly user-tested and completely flopped, when in fact it gets re-released a few years down the line with proper testing and it takes off like crazy. so, you're right, timing is very important,
Ed, d do you know what season of the year or time of the year is the most important for T_V_ remote control sales? Would it be the Christmas season by any chance? The sports time. Sports season. Right before the Eur the World Cup. World soccer. World Cup soccer, Yeah, that's a good idea. but, so, I'm just ig pointing out a a strategy to do some additional user testing pri and then to launch at a a major sports event That's actually good place to advertise it too. There might be some motion pictures that are coming out that are coming out on D_V_D_ that they need to have a m special remote control to work with it, Maybe some management has got relationships there we can leverage. Yes, the that of course I will convince the management to do that, okay.
so what I will do is I will try to negotiate with the vendors, okay, to get the production cost less, okay, I will speak to the management and how to get you know some more cost down.
and we've incorporated the L_C_D_ screen on the flip panel as part of the design, if we figure out it's too expensive, well then you just take it off. This is our remote control, with the flip panel as you can see. So if you lift up the panel, you can see the lovely yellow L_C_D_ display. S And it's one of those very light, very touchable displays. Additional feature on the back is that you can have your own customised backing and I suppose you could do the same thing on the flip case on the front.
so then let's come to the finance, I have some calculations which I made as for the budget. So here you can look like the energy and dynamo and kinetic and solar cells. it's optional, somewhat optional and Ed wants the chip on print, that's what we were talking about that. So then we have sample sensor and sample speaker, then we have the wood material, then special colour and push button. actually, our budget was twelve point five Euro, but it's coming to nine point nine five Euro, so we are under below the budget, Well we haven't come to mine yet, so we're gonna have a bit of difference of opinion, yes.. It's gonna cost a long way to c you know, cost a lot of money to market it, is it? on this pr provisionary cost analysis, we do not have a L_C_ display. L_C_ display is gonna be very expensive, No we do, but it's not filled in. We don't have the price up there, you're right, sorry, yes. okay, so if we add approximately two to three Euro per remote, now we're up around about twelve, twelve and a half as to what the company had initially requested. So that means we can put the the L_C_D_ in, yeah. But as far as production I'm putting up a question because we're talking about profit also, and in mine you'll see the problem with our survey, the p the possibility that how many units can be sold, what percentage of the market, etcetera etcetera this is just production cost, it is not advertising cost, it's not transportation cost And that will inflate quite a bit the cost of the the cost of the unit for the company. So to come up with what the company wants is a fifty million Pound profit, we're gonna have to go a long ways. so when it go into the quantity, okay, and the cost will come down. Although customisation, because this is being done, you know, the on on-order basis, it might be the the quantity won't m won't It's
so what I will do is I will try to negotiate with the vendors, okay, to get the production cost less, okay, so then we can save some money, okay, to put into th our marketing or you know the promotions, whatever, okay, I will speak to the management and how to get you know some more cost down.
So now I'm gonna scare everybody out of this project. since we need to have some type of idea on a market we had independent study that says it this this market has an availability to absorb eight mi eight million units per year. Our internal company evaluation puts it between eight to nine million Which means that if we have a target of two million would the company has to take twenty five percent of the market in the first year, which is actually a tremendous amount. if we put an inflated price of fifty Euro at a production cost that cannot exceed twenty-five Euro, with transport, promotion, labour, because we hav gi included the promotion in the cost, transport for the material to the stores or whatever how however we're gonna break this down between our our retailers. At two million units, we have to have a profit of twenty-five Euro per unit to get to the fifty million unit Eu Euro profit. I just did a run down the evaluation of the form, the fan the fancy stylishness of the of the unit, the ease of use, speech recognition, cost, we've gone through these. Now, the company must evaluate the feasibility of being able to take enough of the market to justify in production. but being that the market changes very very quickly, maybe there's no more interest in buying this thing in eighteen months from now. So, now we have to come up with a decision. Can the company sell two million units? Can it sell it for fifty Euros?
Yes, the that of course I will convince the management to do that, okay.
and let's leave it to the Ed for later for once production is over
Okay, let's talk about maybe first for the prototype. I've done a presentation, but it pretty much covers work that we've both done, so if I'm missing anything, Christine can just correct me. from when we were discussing specifying the case in the last meeting, we decided that we wanted an ergonomic shape, so in terms of function, you have to be able to turn the T_V_ on and off, volume and channel control, menu control, voice recognition control, The yellow button you have is the on off button, so it's really big, hard to miss. You have the the red triangles are the toggles for changing the volume. The green are the channel changing. And then you have the numeric pad in the dark blue at the bottom, and on the right-hand side you have the access to the menu on the T_V_, and on the left-hand side you have the the the ability to turn off the voice recognition. the material that we chose was wood, and the colour would be customisable, 'cause you can stain the wood whatever colour. We haven't specified where the speaker or the microphone will be placed. That depends on the s design of the circuit board inside and what room is left I think the microphone is on on the top, on the middle, the under the flip. But it shouldn't be under the flip either, because you can have the remote control closed, but you still might want to activate it by voice. my opinion I think it's better under the flip because whenever you want to the talk, okay, so then you can speak then you can close it. But if you put it on the on the flip, okay, then technical I don't think it's feasible, 'cause most of the time you speak then it will be recognised. I mean the whole point of the voice is that if the remote control is sitting there and I'm too lazy to reach over and pick it up, I can just use my voice. I mean it doesn't have to be on
okay then, l let's wait for the production, okay, then you can evaluate the product, I think he can promote the the brand value and the product value.
it can be on the side somewhere. Yeah, the sides maybe is good.
so what I will do is I will try to negotiate with the vendors, okay, to get the production cost less, okay, I will speak to the management and how to get you know some more cost down.
In fact, we should sell through Amazon, Or eBay, yeah. So I think what we need to do is perhaps to synchronise the final the the launch of a user-tested device with some special event. That's actually good place to advertise it too. There might be some motion pictures that are coming out that are coming out on D_V_D_ that they need to have a m special remote control to work with it,
So no more changes will be made, okay, in this the basic design. So we will introduce m this model and let's introduce in the market and let's take the feedback from the customers, then we can go for the well you have no redesign not you personally, but in the project we have no redesign time and
okay then, l let's wait for the production, okay, then you can evaluate the product, so how it looks like technically and how it look like the real. We probably should do some market tests once we have the prototypes and do some orders and things like that and test-market it.
this is just production cost, it is not advertising cost, it's not transportation cost And that will inflate quite a bit the cost of the the cost of the unit for the company. So to come up with what the company wants is a fifty million Pound profit, we're gonna have to go a long ways. It's gonna be very hard to reduce. so what I will do is I will try to negotiate with the vendors, okay, to get the production cost less, okay, I will speak to the management and how to get you know some more cost down. At two million units, we have to have a profit of twenty-five Euro per unit to get to the fifty million unit Eu Euro profit.
Well I was just wondering about if we're gonna do a product evaluation then what about time for redesign if the users come back and tell us no this is bad, this is bad, we want this done differently. The problem is there might not be a second generation if the first generation flops for some silly reason that we haven't thought of. So no more changes will be made, okay, in this the basic design. Well, every customer, okay, they have their own ideas, they have their own test, okay, so there's no end, there's no limit. No, but there's a difference between releasing a product that has been minimally tested and fine-tuned to suit a general range of requirements versus releasing a product that we think will work but we don't really have anything to back it up. I mean the whole point of user evaluation is to see what real people need. well you have no redesign not you personally, but in the project we have no redesign time and
first we have three steps of making the the remote control. Fir the first thing is th the functional design, We have to look what the needs are, the effects of the functional design, and and how the the the remote control works, so that's where we're going to look in the functional design, The the second thing is the conceptual design, that's the spe the specifications of the components and the properties and the specifications of the user interface. And we have to look what the market is doing for what kind of remote controls are in the market. And the third thing is the detailed design it's exactly how it looks and whatever.
these are two smartboards, with the f s an introduction of that one. And you already saw you know all that that you here can put things in the the red project map. what we're going to do first is You have to draw a favourite animal on the whiteboard and we have to use a different pen colours and different thickness of the pen. and and say why it's your favourite animal. first have to show you, maybe you can come here to have a look how it works. Use pen format. and a different colour can use here line width ten. Just draw slowly, because otherwise it won't work. It's a very nice elephant, you can see. It's a bit slow you can see, this is a bit annoying. and then what's the colour? How do I do It's in format. Just make a new blank new blank page. Maybe you should hold your pen a bit more to the back, let's make it a dog. I make a cat of it. I just draw too quick I think. I thought these pens would be just you write it down and you download it to Word, but you actually got to write on the paper. but I d I I thought it would be just in in in typed words in Word, but it's just a picture. Y you can you can't edit in the edit it in Word. it's not that cool as I th thought it would be. Now we just have to save everything,
Hello. Hello. you all read what we are going to do or not? We're gonna make a remote control. I just made a a simple presentation. that's my name,. we're going to make a remote control, are we going to this agenda of our meeting. You know, this is about twenty five minutes, this meeting. it has to be original, trendy, user-friendly
My laptop is crashing. actually my laptop doesn't work, Okay. I think it works. How does this work? Press F_ eleven. Just draw slowly, because otherwise it won't work. It's a bit slow you can see, How do I do
Yeah, it probably would be universal. I don't think you can buy a a a universal remote control for twenty five Euros, I know you can buy a re a universal control for only twenty Euros we we just say we just say that's universal remote control. And also for the V_C_R_ and D_V_D_ player so a lot of buttons on the remote control.
what what what's a remote control, it's just a black thing with some buttons on it, we can try to make it special. if we control the V_C_R_ and the D_V_D_ player player with it it has to be clear, And how big should it be? It shouldn't be too big, but I don't think we can make it too small, We can't make it smaller than the things we see now I think. Or we have to make something like mobile phones that you can fold it opem. maybe more trendy. Fold open, where you can see more options. I think something on top, just dren general things like volume and T_V_ channels and inside things you don't use that often. O or you could th think of an a small touch screen on the remote control. Why should you use a touchscreen on a remote control? or maybe to keep it easy and small. But it's not t t t too expensive to put a touchscreen on it. And we have to care for the strength of the remote control, because remote controls are most things in the house that falls down on the ground and it get often broken. And if you have a touch screen in it, it's definitely too too fragile fragile. You can put games on your remote control. Whatever.
Ma maybe a home station. should you put it in a recharger but yeah, we have to look at the price now I think. because maybe it's too expensive. if you th look at the market, it's probably it's still the best way just to put batteries in it, but a home station is a really good idea, The option, just the option, that's cool.
what we know is that we have to sell this remote control for about twenty five Euros. And we have to make a profit of fifty million Euros, so we have to use a big market in Europe. The production cost are about half the price of selling price, can someone make a a calculation about how many we have to sell of these to make fifty million,
for m for me the Marketing Expert, the user requirements specification, do I need to think as a user, what's in the market, I think this if you you have to n know if it's for s a T_V_, a D_V_D_ player, all that things. what kind of buttons do you have.
we're gonna have a little discussion about what experience are with a remote control the and everything, my first question was does it have to be a a universal remote control? that's a good question. Because we sell it lonely from the t and not with the television, we sell it apart.
Yeah, it probably would be universal. we we just say we just say that's universal remote control. And also for the V_C_R_ and D_V_D_ player
We have to close this to finish this meeting, for m for me the Marketing Expert, the user requirements specification, do I need to think as a user, what's in the market, I think this if you you have to n know if it's for s a T_V_, a D_V_D_ player, all that things. what kind of buttons do you have.
And how about the batteries? should you put it in a recharger Ma maybe a home station. but yeah, we have to look at the price now I think. how much is your standards mobile phone recharger? if you buy it separately from your phone it's probably expensive, but I don't know what the project projection costs are for such a thing. because maybe it's too expensive. if you th look at the market, it's probably it's still the best way just to put batteries in it, but a home station is a really good idea, because lots of people are lose their remote control and don't know where it is, Maybe use it as a separate option. Sell it separately. and and you just have normal batteries that you can recharge and just put it in the station, or you can change your batteries, The option, just the option, that's cool.
I I set something on paper already, size, looks, usable, the buttons on usable places, the the on off button must be on top, it has to lay good in the hand, does it has to b have to be like a different form than a normal remote control if if we want to make it special, we probably have to do a lot of testing, if it really works. you can have the basic things on the same place, like on off button on top and the T_V_ channels one two three four as a block, and then the volume obviously on t on top, so you can see. so if you have a clear button with an good icon on it, it should be clear as well. But the rest is you don't use that often, And what we have to think about too is buttons that you use often are maybe like when you fold it open, on on top are the the basic options on top, basically when I'm watching T_V_ I'm just using like five buttons or so, maybe it's very hard to to make it fold open and to l look like it's very. If you if if you make to fold open it's or also an the strength is not s as good as a normal remote control. So maybe we have to to keep it like a square, just normal remote control. Just think about it.
we can try to make it special. Or we have to make something like mobile phones that you can fold it opem. where you can see more options. I think O or you could th think of an a small touch screen on the remote control. Why should you use a touchscreen on a remote control? But it's not t t t too expensive to put a touchscreen on it. And if you have a touch screen in it, it's definitely too too fragile fragile. And what we have to think about too is buttons that you use often are maybe like when you fold it open, maybe it's very hard to to make it fold open and to l look like it's very. If you if if you make to fold open it's or also an the strength is not s as good as a normal remote control. So maybe we have to to keep it like a square, just normal remote control. Just think about it.
so we just can skip the L_C_D_ r on the remote control, I I think we can speak, we can skip speech recognition directly, Yeah, I tho I think that's not usable. I don't think it's useful enough to take the effort to design something with speech recognition. Okay, no speech recognition.
we can make the normal one also a normal light. Not a LED light, but as a normal one. if you if you use the buttons, both of them works. Maybe you have to put a small light around the button you push. Yeah, I think so. If you press something, it lights up for a few seconds, It's the same as the telephone. Yeah.
We definitely should use it. when you use teletec teletext, you can press a green or a red button to go to the next one, or to go to the previous one. but maybe you can put the g the options of teletext on the second level of the remote control. I use te teletext every day, I think. we just keep it one level then?
I just got a email from the from the personal coach and it should be a T_V_ remote control only. it still has to be f a r a remote control for kids and elderly. All these points we have to look at. The the main people of interest of this company are forty plus people. So we have to look at that as well. 'Specially old people, maybe bi bigger buttons or something, So make it just a different colour or different shape,
And the the forty plus people, I already told you. Oh, this is a problem. Oh sorry about that. The new product should reach a new market with customers are the younger than forty. So it should be flashy or just more interesting. that's It changes things. That kinda changes the whole situation. then we have to make some nice features. but younger people I think more often use the internet and elderly people often use teletext.
I've used a marketing report on the site. I think you've read it too. and f and furthermore I surfed the o the other site. I didn't get it anyway. I I was the only one who get it. it was a report about an experiment with a lot of users. And they had a lot of findings in their report with statistical thing with statistical proof. I I had three pages with findings and sev a lot of a lot of findings. seventy five percent of the users find most remote controls ugly. so we have to make a beautiful remote control. eighty percent of users would spend when a remote control will l look fancy. Older people will spend more money for something what's good. Because younger people are more critical about where they spend their money money at. seventy five percent seventy five percent of the users say they zap a lot. I think we we have to make good zap buttons. The last point is quite an interesting fifty percent of users say they only use ten percent of the buttons. And maybe our fold open system is is a good one, we should have the ten percent on the on the top, Remote controls are often lost somewhere in the room. That's exactly what we said about maybe a home station for for it to recharge the batteries or something. I thought mo maybe we could make a clap system, so when you clap your hands it will beep or something. you must find it quickly.. Maybe just a button on the home station. So remote control beeps when you click that button on the home station. we can combine that. it takes too much time to learn how to use a r new remote control. I think we must t take a look at this. It's only th thirty four of the thirty four percent. But it's a tough one. next, remote controls are bad for R_S_I_. Because if we make a ha whole new product, our own style, we we c this is so
that's not very good, because I thought about television, D_V_D_ player, stereo and V_C_R_. But it's already out of the question, this. my point is, well, I If we ma make a a remote control for only television, I think it's hard to sell it for twenty five Euros.
we have a new age of forty plus. But y But you but you already said that the company was about forty plus clients? so we just can skip the L_C_D_ r on the remote control, I I think we can speak, we can skip speech recognition directly, because it's not reachable for twenty five Euros.
Technical functions design. But we have elderly people, so we need to keep it simple. Not too full, like Jens already said, only ten percent is being used. what do you think of only the numbers and the on-off button or But yes basic functions like numbers and that sort of stuff. the options that we put on there should be easy to use, and 'cause you have more room then, and for elderly people big buttons. an icon on it or text on it, so it's very clear what that buttons does. a way to find out what people use is maybe just to use questionnaires on the internet Of functions I could think of. volume, channels, the the basic according to. Just one two three etcetera. text service options. basic on-off. play, pause. I dunno if that's usable miss Did I miss any other buttons, basic buttons? that's the only th the only thing you need. the p next and previous. Li like a web browser, Six seven eight or five. But there's also a button to go to the channel you've been before. Like a web browser back button. but I think it's all too difficult for old people. just use when you wanna switch between channels all the time. I think f Especially for older peo elderly people use standard buttons. Yeah, the ten plus button. Just one one pressing, or quickly after each other. w wouldn't it be a problem to Because you h have to be fast enough. But I think that's in the T_V_ as well. That's how the the T_V_ T_V_ handles it. So you have like a five seconds period to press those two buttons. It's the T_V_ who depends that it must be two seconds or three seconds or one second that you must type one or two. So if you have a universal T_V_ controller, you needed one button that has two stripes. Most things in modern T_V_s are also on the menu. So you also need a menu button. And then navigation But we can integrate that with volume
It's the T_V_ who depends that it must be two seconds or three seconds or one second that you must type one or two. So if you have a universal T_V_ controller, you needed one button that has two stripes. So we have to understand what patterns are used to, you know, to make it universal. So that it can be used with all the T_V_s. We have to really understand what patterns are used, Otherwise it won't work. we have to make buttons for that as well, So we have to make a chip that produces patterns to, y you know, to An automatically search function for each television, or something. I dunno how it's exactly how it works. I I use a universal remote control, And you have to put in a number, I have a modern one. And the modern one you you you type search, And after a short time the television turns off. And then you know, oh it it's the right one.
L_C_D_ doesn't work for twelve and a half Euros I think. And I d I don't don't think it's very usable in a remote control, I I don't y you'll use it often, because you can see on the television wh what channel you I think you you have to make it a bit flashy and and popular. because the Like in the mobile phones, usability is not that good I think. But some of you had something to read about speech recognition. Yeah, I tho I think that's not usable. That's very That's fancy. That's cool. Only the numbers, only numbers. furthermore nothing. But only the numbers, one to twenty or something. Yeah, maybe we have to integrate that as well. If it's possible. I don't think it's very expensive actually. I didn't have information about that. And and and does it have to work only in English, or in Dutch too or that's a problem, only in English. Only in English I think. it's probably my job to figure that out, Does it lie in the centre of the room and can you scream from wherever then th we have to think about that. Maybe maybe it's too hard to to realise that. We have short time to to put it on the market, In indeed the languages are a difficult thing. I don't think it's useful enough to take the effort to design something with speech recognition. A someone says that give me one Coke, and the T_V_ turns to one. And then you have to say T_V_ channel one, or something. Not just one, Okay, no speech recognition.
Do we, do we make a light under the under the n under the numbers and everything? Yeah, I think so. If you press something, it lights up for a few seconds, It lights up when it's dark? If you push something, it it all lights up. it it mustn't work all the time. It it have to work only when you use it. if you use one button, it must turn on for twenty seconds, and then it must turn off. It's the same as the telephone. Yeah. when you use teletec teletext, you can press a green or a red button to go to the next one, or to go to the previous one. but maybe you can put the g the options of teletext on the second level of the remote control. teletext options are only four buttons or something. Because you ne almost never use it. but younger people I think more often use the internet and elderly people often use teletext. I use te teletext every day, I think. And I think, 'cause we don't have that many buttons, we just keep it one level then?
Trendwatching. you know what you have to do.
you know what you have to do. Trendwatching.
Could I think of favourites? I always look up the same pages on text and always have to click the number. But if you could make a new option, that you just have to press one button but then you have to remember what favourite is what channel. So you might as well remember the number. Maybe i maybe it's too complicated, I would find it handy, I think, when you just press one button and you get on six six six. But how can you remember what channel connects to what favourite button? If I use my telephone, I never use those buttons to to to call If I don't do it, maybe old people They don't like new features. Right.
the working design. The method I used is search the web. Just the web page provided. basically what happens is you press a button, then a circuit gets closed by pressing the button, like a switch. And by closing that certain circuit, the chip knows what bu button is pressed. Then the chip produces a pattern. Like a Morse code And and sends that to the L_E_D_. and the light emitting diode is producing infrared light. And transmit that to the T_V_. we we also have to have a LED li LED light on it? Ain't it just to to indicate that it's transmitting? Red's l shows up like something's wrong, and green is like it's okay, on most remote controls it's red. the energy source is the battery, basically. that's connecting to all the components. the subcomponent is w I I think it is the button pressed. when you press a button, a switch get closed. So the chip knows what button you pressed. And the chip sends out the pattern to the infrared bulb. So that's the LED, L_E_D_.
The whole the whole remote control becomes green if you press the buttons. I I think the batteries will be a little we have a recharger in it, If we can still make that then It's just to indicate something's on. That it's working. we can make the normal one also a normal light. Not a LED light, but as a normal one. if you if you use the buttons, both of them works. Maybe you have to put a small light around the button you push. So you see green if you push that button. I think it's unnecessary power you use then. But does it make any difference for the energy you use? i it it will look different, Is LEDs beneath the the buttons? Yeah, w around the buttons, or in the buttons even. The same as a telephone, or a mobile phone, or what do you mean? It it only takes a l a little energy and it's not that much. Maybe that's a good idea for old people as well. It's only few LEDs. Only four or something. Four LED. But if we use a battery station, Yeah, that's a good idea, okay.
And the receptor in the T_V_ senses the pattern. So we have to understand what patterns are used to, you know, to make it universal. So that it can be used with all the T_V_s. We have to really understand what patterns are used, Otherwise it won't work. we have to make buttons for that as well, The chip is producing the pattern. So we have to make a chip that produces patterns to, y you know, to An automatically search function for each television, or something. I dunno how it's exactly how it works. I I use a universal remote control, And you have to put in a number, I have a modern one. And the modern one you you you type search, And after a short time the television turns off. And then you know, oh it it's the right one. We have to make a a s a bit more intelligent chip than the standard one. That's when the circuit is closed, it produces the pattern. But ma basically for brands of T_V_ these patterns are different. what you have to do is get these patterns right. What he's doing when he's configuring this pattern, this chip, is trying to switch off the television. And when it's switched off, you can push a button as it's working now, And then he saves that setting
And the the forty plus people, I already told you. Oh, this is a problem. Oh sorry about that. The new product should reach a new market with customers are the younger than forty. So it should be flashy or just more interesting. that's It changes things. I just I just didn't read it well. That kinda changes the whole situation. then we have to make some nice features. I think the thing in the dark is a good way, to make it more like a mobile phone. More modern.
But the the next aspect also in contrast to last year, the feel of material is expe is expected to be spongy. Spongy, like sponge. So rubber, kind of. soft materials. But maybe th that's al definitely a good idea, because you've you're you drop y your remote control very often on the ground. But I didn't knew knew what it means. it's also a stress-ball.
It's very difficult to to to do it. Because it's only twelve and a half Euros you have to spend on every remote control. that's the problem. That's the main problem. Maybe we watch the first the next two presentations. actually we have don't have an idea how much it's gonna cost. But maybe it's cheap and it's easy to implement. if we implement speech recognition, I think it would be better to implement L_C_D_ as well. Since you have to configure speech thing. But a telephone also have a L_C_D_ and and it's about t two hundred Euros. We have to decide on that. I got an email And it says the chip can be simple, regular or advanced. They say a display requires an advanced chip. And this is more expensive than all the other chips. And speech recognition? Yeah, probably too. I I haven't got anything about speech recognition,
I just want to give you Mike again, the first presentation I received an email and I searched on this d document, recent investigation of the remote control market. It has been done in Italy Italy and in another country in Europe, but they found out the most important aspect for remote controls happens to be a fancy look-and-feel, instead of the current functional look and feel. So it's very important for us to create something new. Fancy stands for an original look-and-feel of the case and interface. this aspect is the most important one. It is twice important as the following. The second most important aspect is that a remote control should it technological innovative. that stands for new technical features. And then that This is a point of discussion, because we just decided that we don't make use of L_C_D_ or speech recognition. But we already have the flashing flashing light the third one is the aspect of the remote control should be easy to use. We already discussed that. d our our target group we thought about was young and trendy. So I took that part of the webpage. And it says fashion-watchers of Pari France and Italy, yeah, have detected the following trends. This trends I th trend I think it's not that meaningful for us, maybe. But it's about clothes and shoes. But the the next aspect also in contrast to last year, the feel of material is expe is expected to be spongy. Spongy, like sponge. So rubber, kind of. soft materials. But maybe th that's al definitely a good idea, because you've you're you drop y your remote control very often on the ground. But I didn't knew knew what it means. it's also a stress-ball. because a fancy look is the most important thing for remote control control, I think about changeable fronts. maybe a see-through one in a a fruit front. And some basic colour fronts. maybe an extraordinary shape, like a sponge. just another shape than a normal remote control ha has. We have to discuss about that. Main point still
but they found out the most important aspect for remote controls happens to be a fancy look-and-feel, instead of the current functional look and feel. Fancy stands for an original look-and-feel of the case and interface. So it's very important for us to create something new. this aspect is the most important one.
we're going to talk about the conceptual model. I just show you the m the no the the the the the the minutes, minute. we just talked about it looks. Has to look nice. Usability is very important. People don't want to spend money on something that's similar to cheaper ones. It has to be very basic, not too many buttons. Light switches on if you use a button. text T_V_ still has to be a possibility. And it has to be easy to learn. And the functions are volume, channel to choose channels, an on-off, a mute button, and a text T_V_ button. That are the functions.
I_D_ and U_I_D_ work together on prototype drawing on smart board. That's for the next one.
actually we have don't have an idea how much it's gonna cost. It's very difficult to to to do it. But maybe it's cheap and it's easy to implement. if we implement speech recognition, I think it would be better to implement L_C_D_ as well. You mean these to the low? But I I think w you'll use the switch channels buttons more often than the normal channel buttons, like one two three. Yeah, just th th th other buttons like text T_V_. Put that on the button bottom. m maybe we cho should put that on top, I think th the numbers should be in the bottom, and and the switch channel in the middle. maybe you just have to make it That's not scrollable too easy. It doesn't make a difference, if you put the s the switch channels on side of each other or on top of each other. but I think we we should bu put 'em on top of each other, But but I I think left to right is more often associated with volume, and top down is more with channel changing. I think it will only look more like the old remote controls. but we could do a lot of, lot more curving. But maybe you can just round up the corners a bit. I think it's okay if you just keep it a bit square. But why do we have to round it on the t bottom then? Can we just put it speech recognition in it as well, We just we just skip the the the voca or was it the the speech recognition. do we s keep that? it it would be would be a good feature feature.
Like a very big scroll-wheel. but just not on the top, but on the side of it. I think you'll get a a lot of volume changing when it's not wanted. maybe you just have to make it That's not scrollable too easy. I think th the numbers should be in the bottom, and and the switch channel in the middle. It doesn't make a difference, if you put the s the switch channels on side of each other or on top of each other. I think zapping is the highest priority. but I think we we should bu put 'em on top of each other, But but I I think left to right is more often associated with volume, and top down is more with channel changing. So so if we use that, they will probably have a long learning time. we have to care that it r looks really new. Because we still hold on to the ordinary square remote control. 'Cause wha what I see the only difference i i i in fact is that we use a scroll-wheel on the outside. but i i it should be round in in shape. If we do it like that we have below have we a lot of room to put a nice logo. You have to look at that image of the iPod. and how many fronts fronts do we put on the market then? Maybe you can buy separate ones buy the product. You buy, you get one. And basic. y you can put the bottom of the remote control in recharger? you could put it like that, so top down. Do we have to design that w as well? The docking station? But th Yeah, that can be very simple. Least. But we have to make contacts on the on the remote control and the recharger as well. But maybe you can just round up the corners a bit. As long as it isn is in two D_ we can use all kind of round shapes. but we could do a lot of, lot more curving. I
for volume. For volume, or a channel. here we have also side scrolls. The scroll wheels, that's cool. That's for the volume.
We still want to have a recharger, don't we? Re recharger. Base station. just just batteries, rechargeable batteries. and and we can use the home station kind of thing. So the energy is the recharger. Just a normal battery.
maybe maybe make the the the wha what's it called scroll wheel. Make it in in yellow or something. Just like the colours of Real Reaction.
It it could be like a Nokia, like plastic. With the hard hard buttons. So that should be hard plastic. we just make it plastic. just hard plastic? the case is just a plastic one.
the component design. I looked at some similar devices, and my own common knowledge. this was on the web site. If you aim at a young public, you should use materials that are soft with primary colours like green, blue, red. So flashy kinda colours. shapes should be curved, so round shapes. Not Nothing square-like. iPod is trendy. And it is well curved square. we shouldn't have too square corners and that kind of thing. And sports and gaming device style characteristics.
the buttons. Normal rubber I think. Like normal ordinary buttons. Soft. It it could be like a Nokia, like plastic. With the hard hard buttons. I think rubber really has an odd look. The the the new new modern remote controls, the buttons are part of the the style, I think is part of the remote control itself. it don't come out of the on the background. it's it's all on one level. So that should be hard plastic. But maybe you can m make a round fluff or soft material. basic remote control from normal plastic, the rounds of it from softer s The normal infrared L_E_D_ I think s sufficient. And back light L_E_D_s. but I think there are multiple colour LEDs. And in green colour, the back lights Just make it some different colours. Blue, red and green, or something.
But just in two D_, not in depth. more rounded. but i i it should be round in in shape. You have to look at that image of the iPod. But maybe you can just round up the corners a bit. I think it's okay if you just keep it a bit square.
we have to put our Real Reaction logo as well on the on the remote control. the colours also. So we have ha to ma make it in black, black, yellow. Maybe the sides in yellow and the the the top in black. because we definitely want to make it kind of flashy, to attract a young public. Maybe you can put yellow on the side and black on the on the front. can't we use different fron fronts, with all with the the logo on it? Can we do that? So Like fronts in in red and yellow and blue Still still transparent. Yeah. But with all with logo on it. But anyways it should be transparent. Just like a mobile phone, you can make different fronts on it. Just give five with them, just in a box. Five different but y you could you could make 'em like blue and transparent.
I don't think that's an opportunity.
I had to make a sort of a design. I watched the old remote controls and news com remote como remote controls. So I did some searching on the internet. This is one of the modern remote controls of the moment. I think we should go more to the iPod and M_P_ three players. Mobile phones. just modern modern but still basic. you probably have to make it a bit bigger and a bit smaller. 'Cause remote con control, you can see it here, you have to bo reach both out both sides. And here you just have one, few buttons. I definitely think we should go like this. And then changeable fonts, It's the most important part, I think. And the home base is something like that, something simple. and then I just ordered the the buttons a bit. basic buttons. On-off, mute. And th maybe two others, I dunno. Text buttons. And then the colour buttons, if we want it on. I don't find it very usable, and then yeah we saw the the pla display, in the the iPod. They can put the basic buttons, one, two, three, four. And f above ten. That's on on the display. That th there is no display there. But it's on the place of the display. And I think we should light this up much more than that part. my personal opinion is that we should go more modern look. M_P_ three player. if we want to put in speech rec recognition or something, we I don't think we should put it on top then. I think that, if we're gonna put in more technology, that you need to be able to switch it open. if you put in speech recognition, you need so more many more buttons.
I_D_ and U_I_D_ work together on prototype drawing on smart board. That's for the next one. But you definitely get a specific instruction. But th think about something that's more rounded. Yeah, five. Let's give five.
Can we just put it speech recognition in it as well, Probably we need a advanced chip then. it it would be would be a good feature feature.
So you don't see all the buttons you else need. But it sounds very difficult to use. Because the volume and channel is on the on the the bottom of it. So you can't use your thumb for it. here we have also side scrolls. I dunno if we can use that. Do we want to use for volume. For volume, or a channel. then we can even simplify it more. By just putting the volume on the side. And and just channel buttons here. The channel buttons are often used. And you can't use them now with your thumb, m maybe we cho should put that on top, and buttons we we don't use on, in the bottom. Yeah, just th th th other buttons like text T_V_. Put that on the button bottom. You mean these to the low? Except from the on-off button. But I I think w you'll use the switch channels buttons more often than the normal channel buttons, like one two three. So maybe we can put that on the bottom. I think it's pretty standard, these rubber buttons on the top. I think it's modern to light this area up, and to light this area up. I think th the the top buttons are okay. They sh Those should be on top. But we we can switch those two,
But I think we have to make the case transparent, you can just make them around the buttons the battery contacts, like normal batteries ca you can put in. We still want to have a recharger, don't we? Re recharger. Base station. just just batteries, rechargeable batteries. and and we can use the home station kind of thing. It's just batteries, It's dark in the room. But you mostly use it indoors, Or we can also use solar cells. for the energy source we can use batteries or a kinetic Like with the pulse watch. cases, flat, so uncurved. two D_ curved is like front to the back. And three D_ curved is also in depth. but with three D_ curved remote controls, we must use rubber buttons. So we can't use the flat buttons. these kinda materials can be used. we just make it plastic. And the L_C_D_. we need the expensive, most expensive chip, if we use an L_C_D_. I don't think that's an opportunity. are are we using a a rubber case, I don't think a rubber case looks The trend is spong spongy and fruit or fresh fresh. fruit and veg can be just the covers. I can't imagine a soft remote control. Titanium, I think it's too expensive. just hard plastic? Not the sh the square form. you can make it curved or round. But just in two D_, not in depth. more rounded. So the energy is the recharger. We have to decide which one we're going to choose from these. What exactly. Just a normal battery. the case is just a plastic one. Yeah th yeah, the chip is the the regular one. And we need a plastic case, with a scroll wheel.
and how many fronts fronts do we put on the market then? Yeah, five. Let's give five.
Yeah, we just made a Word file with the basic elements. Simply a square with round corners. the material should be hard plastic. colour changeable, and also transparent. The functions are just basic. Mute function, on-off function, text functions. And the logo is over here, and the mic. So how many functions do you need for for the microphone? Yeah, speech recognition. I didn't have a specification of that. But I can imagine that you have to input your voice or something. Only one button to say it's on or off. Yes, you need options to configure it, and after that you don't need 'em anymore. Well we haven't had time to design that, the slide pad. I can imagine you need at least four buttons or something. So on-off buttons, text buttons, mute buttons are together and at a place they easily are, easy to find. the on-off button is a bit bigger, so it stands out. It's basically the be standard place for scrollwheel, as far as I know. It's twelve buttons. F the form well, we've taken that from the iPod, other popular technical device. we'll use hard plastic. Since that allows us to use two D_ buttons, non-rubber buttons. We have decided in the the channel buttons, there's a little colour around it. And also in the num-pads, there's also colour light behind it.
Are we doing the the speech recognition? Okay, but it's still possible financially. Okay yeah. Well then then we're gonna put it in. Or are we making a slide open, like underneath? Slide open is quite usable for remote controls. It's may maybe a bit stronger as well. Yeah, we're gonna use the advanced chip then. No, you have a different chip for speech recognition. So So I already calculated that and it's still in the budget.
So these are the last notes we I made. F You're going to show your pr prototype presentation after me. If anything doesn't look right, just say it to me then.
Okay, maybe we use this button for the Okay, there is one function I use daily, and it's not on the basic functions. It's to switch to your Scart. Just just draw a second level one and say all options that are still left or something. Right, the video channel, Play Station, etcetera. That's used pretty often. So here are multiple speech buttons, I don't know how many. menu buttons with arrows. Maybe one button to switch the colour of your LEDs? Colour buttons. Yeah, maybe some some text next to the scroll wheel, that it is volume. There's one text button I prefer. That's the one that you use if you search for a page, like seven hundred, and it's counting from one hundred to two hundred, you will switch to your television and back to text. If you if you turn teletext on, you you set the seven hundred, and you turn it off, then the next time you turn it on, it still stays on seven hundred? That's a functionality for the television. the remote can send like the the code for seven hundred, page seven hundred to the television. Th th th if you switch it on.
We have decided in the the channel buttons, there's a little colour around it. And also in the num-pads, there's also colour light behind it.
on-off buttons, text buttons, mute buttons are together and at a place they easily are, easy to find. the on-off button is a bit bigger, so it stands out. It's basically the be standard place for scrollwheel, as far as I know. It's twelve buttons.
Digital pen is horrible. But if you want to download it to your computer, it's doesn't work. Well smart board would be very nice to work with, if it worked really well. Yeah, i if if it would be faster, it would be great. Yeah, the drawings are are hard to make, I think. Just old fashioned kinda blackboard style. But you might as well do it in normal computer style.
colour changeable, and also transparent.
I think we we got wrong information at the wrong time. I think that was the m biggest problem.
It's kind of weird that we we get this information now, afterwards. Like the prices. If we knew that before, we could have had discussion really s really quicker.
Well we haven't had time to design that, the slide pad. And h how does the second level come out? it slides along?
Okay, let's have a look at this one here, the production cost of it. Yeah, there are some that they didn't mention, because recharge is not on the list. So I think we are pretty much in the right direction, because it's twelve point three Euros. But but is it inc Does it include a a homestation or Can we make that for h twenty cents? The b the button supplements, I didn't I d I was wondering if this special colour maybe was But this is expensive, the sample speaker. Is that included? In the twelve Euro or
So how many functions do you need for for the microphone? Yeah, speech recognition. I didn't have a specification of that. But I can imagine that you have to input your voice or something. Only one button to say it's on or off. Yes, you need options to configure it, and after that you don't need 'em anymore. I can imagine you need at least four buttons or something. So So here are multiple speech buttons, I don't know how many.
Yeah, I made some criteria, so we can ev evaluate our model. and we have to test the criteria from one to zero. We sh we we we can give it a number, and then we can give ourself an average for our And we have to discuss about, if we give it a one or a seven. If it's really, if you can if you can get the iPod look, then it's beautiful, I think. The basic colours are black or green or yellow? Maybe company colours? A bit a bit of yellow. Yeah, grey. Just dark grey I think. Changeable fronts, so ev for everyone for everyone it's something beautiful. Okay, just give it a two. The fancy look-and-feel. And we can change the colours, so that's really fancy I think. It's pretty cool. If you slide it open, it lights up. And th and the the normal backlights also not the buttons, but behind the buttons. I think it's one. Learnable? Easy to use? it's it's very easy to use, but the second layer is not easy to use. And you on don't have to pay attention to that second layer. Because because I think I think the scroll wheel, it's very handy, but the first time you get this thing in your hands, it's not to use the scroll wheel. Then a two. New features. Techno technological innovative? And the scrollwheel, backlights, slide. The speech function is new. and the slide. I think the slide is pretty new. But then we also have the the home station. We are forgetting about that now, but Yeah, we didn't draw that too, but Okay. And new features, so we give it a two or also again a one? No, just so it's still a two. Yeah, but did we reach, with our style, the targeted audience? You get the fancy things for younger people. And you get the the aesthetic things for older people. But we didn't follow the latest trends. Yeah, you could make a a front Like a a f banana kind of front. So we give
It's twelve buttons. It's basically the be standard place for scrollwheel, as far as I know.
I think just I just write a final report. Fill in the questionnaire.
the material should be hard plastic. colour changeable, and also transparent.
So we can do the project evalu evaluation now for for everything together. Was there room for creativity? i Yeah, I think so. Yeah m If we got a high mark for innovativeness or innovativity I think we discussed a lot of things about it. So Okay, so the leadership Just normal discussion, I think. Not one leader or something. team work the third meeting I think that one was pretty hard. We were not all We were not agree with every not agree with. I think we we got wrong information at the wrong time. I think that was the m biggest problem. Like the prices. If we knew that before, we could have had discussion really s really quicker. But the teamwork was okay. Yeah, everybody could speak their opinion. I think everyone listen to each other. The smart board is okay. Digital pen is horrible. But if you want to download it to your computer, it's doesn't work. Well smart board would be very nice to work with, if it worked really well. Yeah, i if if it would be faster, it would be great. Yeah, the drawings are are hard to make, I think. Just old fashioned kinda blackboard style. But you might as well do it in normal computer style. New ideas found. I don't know what it mean. To gather, or to work together, or new ideas for Yeah, but still, you couldn't make a fancy a f you couldn't make a a prototype out of this. Because we don't have any sizes and Yeah, but it You can't possibly do that in such a short time, I think. Yeah, this this is just the idea phase,
And the Marketing Expert should come up with user requirements. therefore we have to to do some internet search. For example for well what kind of applications do current remote controls support, and what are f featur features of current and future televisions?
this industrati Industrial Designer should produce a working design. the use of the Industrial Designer can work on the working design, etcetera etcetera.
And it seems you get more information by email.
we can sell them at twenty five Euros.
the aim is to reach to sell as much as fifty million Euros.
And the production cost should be the half of the selling price.
I I think we have first to start with the basic functions and we can expand them. but you'll ne need several other buttons for a video player. We could just start with the assumption that's only for T_V_ and video. And reserve the possibility to add other features.
we have available the smart board and the whiteboard. we should take some practice. I have some instructions now to do that. you know how to the documents work. this for toolbar. You see it next. And we can use this pen to perform. It doesn't always work. and in the format menu you can select colour and line width, etcetera etcetera. Each of you can take some practice and you should draw an animal. you should explain with different colours and with different pen widths. And you should explain why you draw that particular animal. Different pen widths, how do you do that? with the format menu. And use different colours etcetera. It's a giraffe. Yeah. Can you use one blank sheet per drawing? Or so y you must save it at the end you can press the next button, I in the file option menu. Is this part of our a acquai or introduction to each other? introduction and get acquainted I'm guessing a turtle. How to select the next or Colours were under format A fox yeah. It's a cat.
let's get started. opening acquaintance, tool training, how to use the things here. project plan discussion, and yeah then the rest of the meeting. we're supposed to develop a new remote control, that's both original, trendy and user-friendly. we're work we're working from top to bottom. functional design, then we do some in individual work, then we have a meeting to discuss the results, etcetera etcetera. And at the end of the day we should have a prototype drawn up.
and I'll see you again when the computer tells us to. Let's see what we got to do.
I I think we have first to start with the basic functions and we can expand them. like l li like some like some some remotes who are out there, which I know, there's one button which is very easy to switch between devices. So you can switch to your video and then the same buttons control your video. And another function I'll think of switch to your media centre, but you'll ne need several other buttons for a video player. You need a play and a forw fast forward and a stop function. And you you don't need that for a T_V_. And and for a t teletext you need additional buttons as well, so I kind of need to know what we need. and then we can discuss it with the next meeting. We could just start with the assumption that's only for T_V_ and video. And reserve the possibility to add other features. So we have a basic starting point so make sure it's extendible. Yeah. and you can always extend that it it has yeah it has to be user-friendly. Th the least amount of functions possible
the User Interface Designer should specify the technical functions.
we each have a specific task, I didn't know if you received the same mail. as I saw in my mail. this industrati Industrial Designer should produce a working design. the User Interface Designer should specify the technical functions. And the Marketing Expert should come up with user requirements. did any of you already do some work on this part I started making an overview for myself, what I had to do, and in every step I have a s specific task to perform or whatever. 'cause we have three design steps and what did the Marketing Expert do? from a marketing perspective, well the function des design phase consists out of the user requirements. what needs and desires are to be fulfilled? there are a few means to reach that by by doing research to see what existing products are there out in the market. I mean, what functions do they have. especially what are their shortcomings? Are there any new functions which can be added to our product? therefore we have to to do some internet search. For example for well what kind of applications do current remote controls support, and what are f featur features of current and future televisions? and we can interview current users and future users. What w what would they like to see on a new remote control? especially for future users, I'm thinking of early adopters, because they they use new technology first, but have you any idea so far as what the user requirements are? No n not specifically.
we have a financial aspect to this project. we can sell them at twenty five Euros. the aim is to reach to sell as much as fifty million Euros. that's quite a big amount of money. And the production cost should be the half of the selling price. now it's time for some discussion. I'm taking notes.
the use of the Industrial Designer can work on the working design, etcetera etcetera. I'm just a bit wondering what we're gonna do the next session? Do we only have to to do phase one, the functional design? After that we are going to the conceptual we have meeting, individual work, meeting. And at the end of the day we have a final meeting. I mean, is it gonna be a multimedia control centre? Do we want to be able to use the video recorder with it? I think that is the user requirements part. As to what they want. do they want all those functions on that small But but we need good communication about this stuff, So if I don't know what components to put in, it's kind of hard.
And do you have any ideas about the product so far? I started I started with the first phase, I had to focus on the working design, which you said. I basically had two points. according to the coffee machine example, I have batteries to supply energy, and we ye use button presses to activate or deactivate certain functions on the T_V_. I got another point. It uses infrared light to communicate the signal to the T_V_ apparatus or stereo. it's some buttons for for the on off function. And for the changing up to the to all the channels and changing the volume. That are the the basic options for a remote control. I mean, you wanna ch ch flip the channel but you might wanna use teletext also. I got some requirements it has it has to be user-friendly. really easy to use buttons, not not very small buttons, but not the the also the big big buttons, It has to be a small unit. you can take it with you everywhere in in your house. and a and a good zapping range. the distance from your television to your remote control has to be, yeah yeah, quite a big distance. I don't think I have anything more to add at the moment. I think we can go ahead with what we have. I will summarise the things we discussed and put it in the project folder.
Okay shou should we make a list of the of all the functions we want Yeah so what we might wanna do is yeah cust I have customised the screen functions, if you know what I mean. The the simple functions for for the the whole public, and the the advanced options for the younger people yeah who are more yeah experienced with you can make a if you make a drawing. Basic. so it should fit right in into your hand. Okay so y yeah you have you have it in your hand, and the screen is below, and the buttons are in the middle. But it should be if the screen is here then the logo should be like on on top, And for the speech recognition part, if we want to incorporate that, we need a microphone. Yeah I mean a screen on top looks more lo logical to me. So we put this on top, and then make the corporate logo I mean this is basically numbers, volume, channel up and down. Yeah so we we needed to integrate the sound and and image options right? So channel programming? Yeah a audio settings, mono, stereo, pitch, bass, treble. Screen settings, brightness and colour. S swap channels? Swap's good option. That's very good idea. Hey is it interesting for users if we put LED lights under the buttons? So that if you press on the menu function that only the buttons that are used for the menu are ligh li light up. The pr the problem with the okay button in the middle is, sorry, is if you're pressing up and down, you can easily press the okay once you, when you're not already at your choice. So maybe make one one okay button and and one navigation button. Yeah okay. So on the on the top is better. Depends on the sensitivity of the microphone, but I think that's okay.
But it also needs to have corporate identity. so the the logo has to be present yeah, and the colours as well. And the corporate identity should be clear in the design of the remote control.
I w I should put the the yeah the extra advanced options on the onto the onscreen display. Under the a yeah advanced option menu you can put those things. you have basically a button menu, which you can use directly, according to the old principle. And the L_C_D_ options are activated by some some software options, thats communicates with the infrared decoder yeah. Yeah a audio settings, mono, stereo, pitch, bass, treble. Screen settings, brightness and colour.
I spent a lot of time thinking about what I was gonna do and then a couple of minutes before this I get my function you know the information that I need. This presentation is mainly based on my own ideas 'cause I hadn't time to intergrate tha the information yet so Well my presentation is a bit sucky. yeah well I was working on this before I got my information. So I was just working off the top of my head and using my colin common knowledge about remote controls. And well the info on the website which came too late. But yeah then the information came and it was kind of exact with all the steps in the remote control that I had to follow, so I was trying to organise them for myself.
The User Interface Designer can design a menu for all these function and I think you can concentrate more on the button placement and the placement of the screen itself on the
Hey what's wrong with my computer? I think you have to change your desktop Yeah my computer is not functioning properly. Did you plug in the power cable when you come back? You pressed alt F_ four? No no no. I pressed the mouse button.
I'm gonna talk about functional requirements. Well some research has be done has been done. observing of one hundred subjects in the usability lab using a remote control. and they also filled in a questionnaire. They disliked the look-and-feel of current remotes controls. Users think they're ugly. they are often lost somewhere in the room. it takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote control. And they're bad for R_S_I_. they do not match the the operating behaviour of the users.
and I have to write very fast to make the minich min minutes.
most irrelevant and less used were audio settings, mono, stereo, pitch, bass. most relevant, most used functions, power button, channel, volume selection. teletext but we can skip that because I saw the newsflash, and teletext is so outdated that it it's i should not be used any more in the future.
And we do have to integrate the screen and the the speech Menu button access the menu in the L_C_D_ screen.
well we have to keep all the classic functions but make the buttons as user-friendly as possible. And I think and certainly for for the for the lower age groups, nice design, which does not make the remote control in your room.
all the functional aspects of the remote I think are in my department.
Okay. So he's layout and you're function. Isn't that more the the u the user interface part? I think that's a that's a good separation. Yeah we have to kind of work together.
By the way where did you guys get that newsflash from? I receiv the mail but you don't. So No so it's a text file n in the project folder. And the new product should reach new markets, which is the customers below forty. But it also needs to have corporate identity. so the the logo has to be present yeah, and the colours as well. Yeah but the the newsflash also stated that it should control only one device, only your television.
And the new product should reach new markets, which is the customers below forty. it should be designed for a use g group below forty, the marketing research started on s on the age of sixteen. sixteen to forty.
I had two examples. this one is the the yeah the advanced one with a lot of options and functions and buttons. This the easy one I think we have to to combine them. And yeah merge the best functions of all examples. Okay so so we have the option for more functions. Yeah but I prefer we we use the the basic options yeah. We have to to make them very easy so for just zapping around the channels you can just push one button. yeah only use a extra function if they are really needed. so maybe you can hide them or something. So it looks very simple and all the advanced features are hidden in the screen, with a clear menu. So we have to make a compromise between functionality and fashional fashionable
Yeah a audio settings, mono, stereo, pitch, bass, treble. Screen settings, brightness and colour. Menu button access the menu in the L_C_D_ screen. And then with these buttons, woa, y you navigate.
And we do have to integrate the screen and the the speech So what does the screen do? For for the advanced functions I think. Well I, my guess is it's it's pretty handy for advanced advanced functions.
Yeah but the the newsflash also stated that it should control only one device, only your television. for those that didn't see yet the basic new requirements of the management were no teletext, only for T_V_.
but we can skip that because I saw the newsflash, and teletext is so outdated that it it's i should not be used any more in the future. for those that didn't see yet the basic new requirements of the management were no teletext, only for T_V_.
Well my presentation is a bit sucky. yeah well I was working on this before I got my information. So I was just working off the top of my head and using my colin common knowledge about remote controls. And well the info on the website which came too late. But yeah then the information came and it was kind of exact with all the steps in the remote control that I had to follow, so I was trying to organise them for myself. I mean everything speaks for itself I guess. Mean you press a button the it tru goes, it sends a signal to a chip, which translates it into infrared signal of certin spatial frequencies. and the T_V_ will translate it into a function.
I thought but this is really your department, that we need just the functional display and four cursors. most of the time you have one button in the middle. It says menu, and then if you press it you the screen gets activated and then you can use these buttons to scroll up and down and left and right to go into functon and then on on each on each screen there's there should be an option to go back to a to a upper level.
Hey is it interesting for users if we put LED lights under the buttons? So that if you press on the menu function that only the buttons that are used for the menu are ligh li light up. That's very good idea.
So we put this on top, and then make the corporate logo Yeah okay. So on the on the top is better.
So we only, we already decided that kinetic would be the choice for energy.
You will do the evaluation. You probably get a mail. Yeah but maybe you can do the evaluation you don't have to evaluate yet but you can make a procedure which to follow.
but basically you two are going to work on the smartboard. Next thirty minutes to design something so So we're gonna work here? On this sketchboard?
most important aspect for remote control happens to be a fancy look-and-feel. Instead of the current functional look-and-feel. And the second most important aspect is that a remote control should be technological innovative. I think we pretty much covered that with our screen and and speech recognition, And the third development is that the remote control should be easy to use. Well the first aspect was twice as important as the second aspect,w which was twice as important as the third aspect. I first chose for the battery, 'cause yeah I'm traditional and that's the most obvious, easiest choice to go to. But I really think that we should maybe think about the kinetic energy,
Advanced chip. Okay.
So welcome to the marketing presentation once again. fashion watch watchers have detected the trends for young public, because that's our public. fruit and vegetables will be will be the most important theme for clothing, shoes and furniture. And the feel of the material is expected to be spongey. oh yeah well this is the fruit and vegetables looks of fresh bright colours. most important aspect for remote control happens to be a fancy look-and-feel. Instead of the current functional look-and-feel. And the second most important aspect is that a remote control should be technological innovative. I think we pretty much covered that with our screen and and speech recognition, And the third development is that the remote control should be easy to use. Well the first aspect was twice as important as the second aspect,w which was twice as important as the third aspect. nothing about the buttons but just sponge kind of thing, and and some fruit and colours Just made a quick design.
the case would be doubly curved. So Rubber material.
I didn't get any information about that so I'm just thinking, this is not my department, but I I'm not sure what this is gonna cost, Advanced chip. Okay. Rubber material. the case would be doubly curved. So So we only, we already decided that kinetic would be the choice for energy. do you have a picture of doubly curved case? This is the the menu I was looking at. S see this is the the the standard traditional type, where the form yeah serves the function, you know. But this m is more appealing to old people and we don't want that. And th that means curved in both dire dire dimensions. where your thumbs would be laying in the instrument and it has to be nice to hold. And Th this looks a little bit like like for only for children. So Yeah but that's that's the the problem yeah the dilemma actually, 'cause we wanna appeal to the to the young public with fancy with flashy colours, and with a lot of shape. Yeah, and the and the rubber, it it will look cheap always, Okay but the the colours, you you can make it make the colours with LEDs beneath the the buttons. If you press a button and you can disable the the colour LEDs for for people that don't like it. And this is, this is with the curved that I mean. Well we could make a compromise between that. instead of doubly curved we take a single curved. So to appeal a little more to the all the public. Yeah so we keep it singly c single curved then? I would go for the double curved. I mean our aim is to make something different right? And I I'm I'm thinking you know a drawing palette, where you have the shape for your thumb. but if you if you make it more curved we we can make more and more options for buttons. You can make a trigger button or something like that. and we need something that well that that you can able
One one very important thing I was yeah thinking about is the speech option. I think you can just match the speech commands with the functions that are already present. But do j do we do the speech just for the basic options, for the simple buttons? For for everything, in the in the last meeting we we were yeah putting the the simple and the advanced options separated. Pressing the the menu option will disable all other options on your remote control. And only the the L_C_D_ panel will light up and then you can only change the yeah the options. but this is the the the simple layout. display on the upper side with the the menu button and maybe a some sort of cancel button or save button. And if there are older people they wanted more yeah more luxurous so that's an a also an option.
So we only, we already decided that kinetic would be the choice for energy. the case would be doubly curved. So Rubber material.
I'm dealing with the components design. I used some design examples we had from similar products. for example the energy source. we have four types. The basic battery. we have a hand dynamo, the kinetic provision of energy which means if you move the thing, if you shake it. And of course solar cells. for the a case, there's the traditional uncurved flat hard case. Single curved, which means that it has curves in one dimension. Or the double curved. but well you know that we will have to go for the double curved 'cause it's daring and different from what we have now. Well we have all kinds of hard materials like the the hard plastic, the wood and the titanium. I would definitely go for rubber We have yeah several interface designs. we can use a scroll buttons for the menus, but we already kind of decided to go for the f for the pushbuttons, for the the arrow buttons. the advanced chip I think is easiest to implement for the production, 'cause they they can print it better. I can imagine that the kinetic type energy source would be more expensive to make. But it is more longlasting, that the people don't have to ever buy batteries again. and especially when the material's rubber. It can be done, I mean, you can't harm it, No it means curved in two dimensions. So double curved is like this, this, this, or So w single curved? let's say would be a b square box, but then with curves on one dimension.
Okay but the the colours, you you can make it make the colours with LEDs beneath the the buttons. If you press a button and you can disable the the colour LEDs for for people that don't like it. How about we do a a pop-up screen, like the laptop. If you can flip. But I dunno if that's too expensive. Okay so the buttons are on top here, and you flip it over that way. and you can maybe even drop the menu button because maybe if you flip it open it will auto activate amauto automatically. So okay b but you have t you need some button to flip this open. Well yeah the the idea of it was, is that because you close it, you cover the L_C_D_ screen and it won't be vulnerable to scratches or whatever. We just have to make sure that the closing mechanism won't break. I don't know what what colours should the basic print be like? Like some soft green or something? Orange or something. and then and then very bright, a yellow banana, an orange, a green apple, stuff like that, Yeah w we need very primary colours, like bright red, bright yellow. Yeah but the primary colours w we can create with the with the LEDs on the on the remote control. If you make it just a yeah bl give it a blue colour, then it's just a neutral colour, So that's that's a dark blue basic colour I guess. Yeah with some some yellow banana I mean, the the colour of the background of the display? So just just a a blue blue backlight or something like that. maybe a maybe a white a white backlight? But don't we wanna make the background the the bright colo colours? So th the total of the thing is very bright? But then then again, which colour should the buttons be? But maybe the buttons, all buttons in red is maybe a bad contrast for colourblind people. Red and green are actually the b the easiest to discriminate. Even for colourblind
instead of doubly curved we take a single curved. So to appeal a little more to the all the public. Well we could make a compromise between that. Yeah so we keep it singly c single curved then? I would go for the double curved. I mean our aim is to make something different right? but if you if you make it more curved we we can make more and more options for buttons. So then you have double double curved in some way.
I'm just thinking, this is not my department, but I I'm not sure what this is gonna cost, I didn't get any information about that so
So double curved is like this, this, this, or No it means curved in two dimensions. So w single curved? let's say would be a b square box, but then with curves on one dimension.
. I did get a bit more done than the last time, 'cause I knew that I didn't have time so I just copy and paste everything into the Sometimes I have these pop-ups or these sounds and there's nothing there, and also with I don't know how to use PowerPoint, so it takes me forever to get something done with it.
Oh yeah, we have to do the project evaluation. So how were did the project process go? Did you, were you all pleased with the process as it was? Yeah well at first I was really stressed. Because it went a bit fast. But then as I knew the tempo that I had to be on, the second time I think I did a bit better. because at first you you make your individual contribution, and then come here, and you have no idea what the others have to make. And then finally you have some idea, okay this is gonna w this is what we gonna make together and okay I will arrange this and you will arrange that, and you have a k a kind of idea what you can expect on the next half hour when you have to work on your own. So The process, I mean, the interaction between us became better and better I guess. Yeah. Especially after the first meeting. Well you did become more assertive the the second time round, so that was there enough room for creativity? but only the the financial parts Also not only the drawing and the the making of the thing itself, but also in explaining it to the other people, by means of the the board and PowerPoint and Word and stuff like that. So and the about the board digital pen? the digital pen is better than the SMARTboard. Because it it it just works better. But the screen is useful, in essence, but it doesn't work that well. And as I said, I have no idea how PowerPoint works, so will take me half a day to be able to make a normal PowerPoint presentation. Okay, are are there any new ideas about this? It's use especially useful, I guess, to to evaluate designs and graph graphical stuff. I think the PowerPoint is is too limited. Yeah the the the problem with PowerPoint for me is that you have to i put in the pre-made chunks c as well. Yeah. But it it's useful to
The process, I mean, the interaction between us became better and better I guess. Yeah. Especially after the first meeting.
makes three point one one one one one one one. So we're better than average.
Yeah we we have to maybe if we have to redesign it on this Okay we're still gonna go for the fancy colours? Yeah we we can just use this one. And then over-paint it with the green The the button has a special colour, the frame has a special colour. Oh and you might want to add a infrared LED. Well I have to make an report of every decision we made so far. And I try to get chip just before I receive the Excel sheet. but maybe you can help me. Okay, but how do we make the the scroll button? The the target group has a weak spot for fruit and vegetables, like primary colours, spongy shape. Yeah, is it's horizontal or vertical? Well I think I have to make a p an issue called finance. It's not very fashionable anymore. But it's okay. Maybe that's a s a special colour for it. So we can make it special? can we do a print? I'm not sure. Shall we just give it some dots to make it look pretty? We have the original balance sheet, or Okay, it's not the prettiest, I know. Maybe maybe it c it can say that. The Real Remote. Shall we do the logo in black or not? Well it's it's single single curved. But it's it's better to have in the front, this kind of shape, because it looks nice.
That was exactly my point. Like let's drop all the buttons, and just make one I mean we're gonna use the L_C_D_ screen anyway. So we'll just have to use it for everything. Integrated scroll-wheel push-button, yeah. we need one integrated button for everything then. But but th the cost of one integrated button is far more than a few extra push-buttons. if you lose the the Back, the Okay button v let's say we only have the four arrows, and the Menu button. With with one integrated button we can do the whole menu thing. Yeah but it's just a scroll-wheel which you can push down. So Okay. Make it a special colour and then it look fancy.
I Are you sure we this number actually tells us somethings? I don't think so because some questions are related to positive issues and some to negative. Yeah, but there are no negative questions I guess. So it were all positive questions, by by purpose. So Yeah true. Yes, so the It tells us something, yes.
was there enough room for creativity? but only the the financial parts Also not only the drawing and the the making of the thing itself, but also in explaining it to the other people, by means of
It's silly 'cause we we should have had this meeting before we start drawing.
We all have to keep in mind what has changed now. So what we have left on the Because evaluation is based on the initial user requirements. Well we evaluate the design with a seven point scale, as following. Well the criteria are based on the user requirements, the trends from the marketing research, and the marketing strategy of the company itself. And we all have to agree on a certain level. Well the first point is the remote control matches the operating behaviour of the young user. I think it does. Because the operating behaviour of the young user was also defined in colour and shape and the use of L_C_D_, Okay well I say still two, but it has to be three then. The remote control has irrelevant or less used functions. Yeah. Well, yeah. So it it's a very true point. I mean it hides all those function. It shows the relevant and most used functions. It automatically has the the programme and the volume function, Okay five. the the remote control makes use of technolog technological innovation like L_C_D_ screen and speech recognition. Yeah, I say two. Okay, it has a fancy look and feel by using fruit and vegetable prints, primary colours and sponge-like material. So we still we still have the primary colours. But only on the on the outside, not on the button. Yeah still we we dropped also on the the double curve. It should have been two questions. I realise now, because sponge-like material is dropped.. So maybe in the middle or something. Actually we d we didn't do so well on this one. I mean the sponge-like and the three D_ shape, that would give it something young and fresh. the remote control displays the corporate logo. But there's enough space for the corporate logo. I mean, if there's only one thing. And even the shape we have now simulates kind of an R_ and the reversed R_, The remote control is easy to use. Skill, I would say six, or something. I don't think it's easy to use, or not
Do we keep the shape doubly curved or g do we go for single curved? Well I guess i we'll have to go for single curve then. another option I saw was to drop the buttons one through nine, so you can't directly access a channel, but instead use only the up and down arrows. But we don't have any basic options any more. They don't need special colours. So let's go for the plastic. So the only option is an hand dynamo. drop the the special colour, and do the special colour for the buttons. Yeah it has to be curved and has to have that colour.
Yeah, I have still ten minutes to finish the report.
I mean we're gonna use the L_C_D_ screen anyway. So we'll just have to use it for everything. Could drop the speech recognition. There are more people who like speech recognition than an L_C_D_ screen. Yeah. Let's drop the speech.
the the board and PowerPoint and Word and stuff like that. So and the about the board digital pen? the digital pen is better than the SMARTboard. Because it it it just works better. But the screen is useful, in essence, but it doesn't work that well. And as I said, I have no idea how PowerPoint works, so will take me half a day to be able to make a normal PowerPoint presentation. I think the PowerPoint is is too limited. Yeah the the the problem with PowerPoint for me is that you have to i put in the pre-made chunks c as well. Yeah. But it it's useful to to show something to to an a small audience, and then to
Okay. first of all I'll start with the costs, because that's going to influence our design. Because we have a problem. It has to be twelve and a half. You're going to redesign something. Okay, so we're at twenty five.
Because we have a problem. It has to be twelve and a half. You're going to redesign something. Okay, so we're at twenty five.
So the only option is an hand dynamo. Let's let's go for the hand dynamo then.
I mean we have to drop on everything. another option I saw was to drop the buttons one through nine, so you can't directly access a channel, but instead use only the up and down arrows. But we don't have any basic options any more. But but th the cost of one integrated button is far more than a few extra push-buttons. Could drop the speech recognition. There are more people who like speech recognition than an L_C_D_ screen.
Yeah. Let's drop the speech.
Integrated scroll-wheel push-button, yeah. we need one integrated button for everything then. With with one integrated button we can do the whole menu thing.
So let's go for the plastic.
