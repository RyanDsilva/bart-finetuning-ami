Okay,, first is the functional design, this is where we all go off and do our individual work, what needs need to be fulfilled by the product,, conceptual design, and then the detailed design, how we're actually gonna put it into practice and make it work.
We're gonna practice with the pens and draw our favourite animal on the white board, and sum up the characteristics of that animal. I'm going to tell you that's supposed to be a tiger., maybe you can guess what I'm trying to make? A kind of dog? Okay, now I'm gonna have to change what is was originally gonna be Yeah, it can be a crocodile, it can be a crocodile. it's meant to be an eagle
Yeah, I don't I don't know how for twenty fi, or twelve Euros fifty how much of a excellent screen you could get, you'd you'd have to sort of keep it down to a black and white L_C_D_ thing anyway, I'd assume. The other thing is, just ch chucking into mobile phone f design features again, it could have a flip top remote control I think that's a cost thing,
I'm Sarah, the Project Manager Okay, this is our agenda, get to know each other a bit better to feel more comfortable with each other. then we'll go do tool training, talk about the project plan, discuss our own ideas and everything Now, we're developing a remote control which you probably already know., we want it to be original,, trendy, appealing to a wide market, and user-friendly, grannies to kids, maybe even pooches should be able to use it.
but you know on a mobile phone, you can press a key and it gives you a menu, it's got a menu display, I wonder if incorporating that into the design of a remote control might be useful, so you've got a little L_C_D_ display. instead of having too many b buttons and make it complicated for the user, may h maybe have an L_C_D_ di display or something like that, What about the older generation? that's gonna be a problem anyway with the older generation perhaps, I don't like the, you know the new phones that have kind of got a Windows-based running system. I find it really confusing, Yeah, I don't I don't know how for twenty fi, or twelve Euros fifty how much of a excellent screen you could get, you'd you'd have to sort of keep it down to a black and white L_C_D_ thing anyway, I'd assume.
And there's no reason we need to make it look as fashionable and stylish as a mobile phone, it can still be lightweight plastic, you know? Something that's easily moulded and produced. about what you're saying about the does does it need to be fashionable? I I had a quick look at the company website and it's like the the we put the fashion into electronics, I mean you don't you you can still have plastic we don't have to use metal, and the Telewest remote controls are silver plastic, I mean there's Sky remote controls and everything. They're kind of moulded so yeah I guess that's stuff we can think about.
finance-wise, we've got a selling price at twenty five Euros, which I don't actually know what that is in Pounds, at all. Seventeen. Okay, that's expensive. Havi having said that though, if you wanna get one of those the the ones on the market at the moment they're s they're about twenty pounds anyway. production cost's at twelve fifty, so, and profit aim is fifty million Euros, You've got market range international and you did say earlier it's got to be a accessible and usable by sort of all age groups
What are your experiences with remote controls? I mean I've got we got we had three videos, a T_V_ and a sort of amp thing all set up so we got one of the universal remote controls, that you programme each of your things into, but that kept losing the signals but that was quite good, the fact that you could You didn't have six remote controls sitting in front of you. My experience has only been being given the remote control with the object I buy, not doing any tampering with it and programming, I hate I hate looking at a control and seeing a million tiny little buttons with tiny little words saying what they all do And symbols that you don't necessarily understand, So simplification of symbols you could think of. and a section opens up or something to the other functions where you can do sound or options kind of recording, things like that inside it. The other thing is, just ch chucking into mobile phone f design features again, it could have a flip top remote control
so we're all gonna go off and do our individual things. and then we'll come back and liaise again Okay,, first is the functional design, this is where we all go off and do our individual work, what needs need to be fulfilled by the product, what effects the product has to have
, th the shape you got trendy. I mean so many remote controls look absolutely identical, What I was thinking of a design which Nokia h came up with almost six or seven years back. so they came up with something like this, curled up, so here, so it's like you can say a banana shape kind of thing, curled up like a boat. I wouldn't say exactly semi-circular but yeah smooth. I mean for example, if it was a C_ or something like that, you could have it in a vague C_ shape that opens up kind of like a shell, or something, you know even though we're using plastic, you can still I mean think of the designs you can get in plastic, You could have different kind of casings. So you could have like psychedelic ones for younger people and sleek ones and and people might want to put it on their mantelpiece or whatever as a ki if it looks attractive enough as a kind of ornament Yeah maybe we could come at some say five, six des designs
but just discussing the different age groups and targeting the different age groups it occurs to me, to produce our own mobile phones, that that's kind of what led us on to comparing T_V_ remote controls with with their design features,, chain companies like Carphone Warehouse, you can pop in anytime with a phone that you bought for them w if you've got any problems with it and they'll fix it, Is it worthwhile with with our retail outlets having a a similar kind of service so that if older users were deterred from buying this, if they know they can just pop into one of our high street outlets, th you know, which button is it I press for this? Th as free as a free aspect of our service, would that not make it more attractive to them? But the only problem is that with a mobile phone you signed for a contract but I I'm not sure how much the cost would be of having I mean instru instruction books I feel c I reckon can cover that. Instruction manuals. there will be a customer service number thing that you can phone up and speak to for a phone maybe he might walk down the street, but for a remote he will just refer to the manual and all that. But we should focus on making the manual as user-friendly as possible
Okay, so the remote control functions. we've got the T_V_, we've got the video, now there's I can't remember what it's called, the little code at the end of programme details, Video plus. We could use that as an alternative to programming in times, things like that, And you wouldn't you wouldn't need a whole host of extra buttons for that, I've not come across that function if you look in the newspaper, T_V_ guide or any T_V_ guide there's a five, six digit number afterwards I'm not sure if we need a design decision now,, what other functions? oh batteries, that's what I was thinking about. Mobile phone batteries, what kinda battery is that? th the thing that you get with mobile house phones, you sit it in its charger when you're not using it or t at night or something,, something like that should reduce the size of it. yeah if you if you had if you had one of those just coming back to your other point about pressing the button and setting off the bleeper in the room that could So are we talking of a concept of a rechargeable something on the remote? Rechargeable with a docking station. And we've talked about there being an alarm or something, a beeping for being lost,.
further market research will be needed to kind of focus on what that is, it's gonna be different for a fifteen year old th for somebody who's sixty and also across the world if we're aiming at the international market. I'm thinking kind of Japan, I'm thinking young, office people,
we have new project requirements, we're not going to be using teletext, our control is only going to be for T_V_, it's not going to be a combined control, I think maybe Sky things like that might be incorporated into it, but I don't know, what do you think? Would that imply video use? But I mean, general T_V_ controls do do video as well. I think we assume that it's still got play and stop functions and programming. Ju just as an idea on the speech recognition thing that pr it'd probably be quite expensive to incorporate an entire speech recognition thing the third thing was that we have to make sure the corporate image is very much incorporated into the handset. so we want logo, we want fashionable, trendy,
I'm going to look at the functional requirements from the marketing point of view we used our our usability lab, the company's usability lab, we did our usual selection methods to get a cross-section of the general public, all age groups from fifteen upwards and we observed them in the lab, Our findings, lots of findings, I've just summarised some of them here. The overall thing which I've I've got at the top there in italics is that users dislike the look and feel of current remote controls,, we found that seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly. Eighty percent would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy, but that's quite a high proportion of our our, you know, international target group are prepared to spend more money for something that's a bit nicer looking., current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user overall. For example, you can see below there, seventy five percent of users zap a lot,, fifty percent of users only use ten percent of the buttons, and possibly we can also cut back on cost if we don't have so many functions actually on the remote control. the biggest frustrations that people found with regard to personal preferences were something that you you mentioned earlier, remote controls are often lost in the room, fifty percent were were particularly frustrated by that. thirty four percent of people take said they take too much time to learn to use, slightly more than a quarter of people said it was bad for repetitive strain injury. the vast majority of the thirty five and under age group would like a liquid crystal display and speech recognition, again that was to aid I think in when they've lost the actual remote control, some kind of speech recognition. Something we didn't put to them, but which I'm thinking of now is even if perhaps the lost control can give off a bleep every now and again til you find it or a flashing light, possibly. So thirty fives and unders who
, and the rechargeable batteries. Rechargeable with a docking station. So are we talking of a concept of a rechargeable something on the remote? You could have different kind of casings. So you could have like psychedelic ones for younger people and sleek ones and But we should focus on making the manual as user-friendly as possible but for a remote he will just refer to the manual and all that.
Yeah. Actually some of my points might overlap with what William's just mention, but basically my method was like whatever brainstorming we did in the last meeting, just a couple of valuable points and started developing on that and there might be some missing loops in this thing which I think we'll take a feedback from the marketing And to summarise I I would say it's it should be user-friendly by being easy to use, rather than having a lot of complex button because you can have an engineering maybe having hundred buttons and maybe having a remote control which has the main features like volume control or channel ch changing the channel or whatever. So what the concept is to have a flip-top model. The main functions such as which are like often used will be on the top and the complex functions which say you you can say like the y young generation or trendy generation want to pr say programme their favourite channels or whatever, can be put in the middle part of the f flip-top. and we can punch in new f features such as added features such as shock proof body because there are times like people have used a remote control for say a year or something and they they are not used maybe thirty to forty percent of the buttons so we we can maybe go for an economies of a higher production so we can give in add in more features and make it less costly. if you ask me personally, I would make flip-top with a trendy design because they are times when the buttons tend to be a bit hard after continuous use usage and all that. and s maybe we we should look at also like the buttons whe whether they are like soft or little hard
Ju just as an idea on the speech recognition thing that pr it'd probably be quite expensive to incorporate an entire speech recognition thing We do have a budget limitation that we can't control ourselves, so I think when we can take a cheaper option which still does the same kinda thing Yeah but on on that again I just thought 'cause you can get those key chains now and you whistle and then it'll let off a loud noise to let you know where it is
and I found out that most controls use some form of infrared to send signals to the T_V_ presumably because of the cost issue of something like the same thing that computers use, wireless, most of them are powered by some form of battery. Now our one, I'm I'm not sure whether we want to look at the size issue because most of them are powered by triple A_ batteries but those can be quite bulky so I d I didn't know if you wanted to look at something else so we could shrink down the size of the control. You're saying the triple A_ batteries are small or the surrounding it? if you if you look at if you look at most remote controls they're quite they're quite chunky and that's because of the size of the batteries, the triple A_s are the smallest you can get are they not, right? well you can you can get the sort of circular round ones, now the ones at the moment are small but I was just wondering if we could look at something a bit smaller. and then you obviously need something to decode the information that you're putting in from from the controller Now these have a wireless range of up to about five metres we've just got the the power going to the infrared bulb with the chip and the U_I_ interface which would basically, when you when you pressed anything it would the chip would convert it into some form of I_R_ data which could be decoded by the T_V_ receiver, which obviously means that we're gonna have to conform to whatever whatever form of communication that the T_V_s are already using so all the components that I've put forward are low in cost it should should be different enough from the alternative products to get a good consumer base, because they're small they're also easy to lose so if we could look into some way of d dunno some anti-going down the side of the sofa thing that you could have,
Okay this is the working design, What the first thing question I asked was what are we trying to design? Well, a device which basically just sends the signal to the T_V_ to change its state, whether that be the power, or the channel or the volume, everything is just some sort of signal to change the state of the T_V_ or other appliance that it's sending the signal to., so I decided I'd have a look at what th other people have designed and try and take some inspiration from that. But although we will want to be taking ideas from other people, we wanna make sure that our design stands out
and the I the instruction manual, I don't know if we deal with that,. What would you specifically like marketing to look at before the next meeting?
I think we have to design one product Th the internal d engineering design has got to remain the same, yes, absolutely.
I'm thinking young, office people, I'm thinking kind of Japan,
I mean for example, if it was a C_ or something like that, you could have it in a vague C_ shape that opens up kind of like a shell, or something, I think that's that sounds a really attractive idea, something about Videoplus. Video plus.
I'm not sure how long we've got left, but we need to make a decision about the things we've discussed. Do we agree on the battery? The kinetic. so we could incorporate voice recognition for the finding it., that means that there's no function for li the port, I think the only pitfall that we would have would be how much it's going to cost if that means we have to cut down somewhere else, The L_C_D_'s not cheap. Maybe we could start with the black and white. The inside components is pretty standardised across the board isn't it? did we decide on double A_ or triple A_ batteries? the kinetic ones come come with a sort of w watch a battery that goes in a watch. Yeah the well I think were we're going for the L_C_D_ on that one, on the buttons, On the bottom we were gonna have the rubber, the rubber ones,, okay on we've got the flip the flip-screen, the top one is gonna be the L_C_D_ and the bottom one is gonna be the rubberised buttons. For the body design I think plastic, so we decided on a rubber casing for the plastic shell, a variety of designs, we're not gonna try and make it actually a vegetable or fruit design or anything else, like a shell that we discussed, the fact the m the material that we would be using would be cheap, so we could make it red, we could make it psychedelic, This would definitely be different enough, I just wondered if anybody could come up with something even more you could have a plain black one, you could have sparkly pink glittery ones for your little And incorporating the company logo? 'Cause I took it from the feedback you gave in the last meeting from y from y your report, it's not just a case of having a little R_R_ hidden somewhere, they do want it to be obvious that it's our product I think you just address that with advertising. Obviously it'll have a logo on it just like everything
Okay we had a latest finding of voice recognition, there was a mail which mentions that our division has developed a new speech recognition s feature. We have to check into the for financial f feasibility whether we can incorporate it this at a low cost, So it could be like, where is the remote, and the remote answers I am here.
so we could incorporate voice recognition for the finding it. I think the only pitfall that we would have would be how much it's going to cost if that means we have to cut down somewhere else, So we can if financially voice recognition is not feasible we could go for a whistle. Yeah, depending on the expense of it. have we just rejected that in favour of voice recognition then?
Do we agree on the battery? The kinetic., that means that there's no function for li the port, The L_C_D_'s not cheap. Maybe we could start with the black and white. the kinetic ones come come with a sort of w watch a battery that goes in a watch. did we decide on double A_ or triple A_ batteries? Yeah the well I think were we're going for the L_C_D_ on that one, on the buttons, On the bottom we were gonna have the rubber, the rubber ones,, okay on we've got the flip the flip-screen, the top one is gonna be the L_C_D_ and the bottom one is gonna be the rubberised buttons. For the body design I think plastic, so we decided on a rubber casing for the plastic shell, a variety of designs, we're not gonna try and make it actually a vegetable or fruit design or anything else, like a shell that we discussed, the fact the m the material that we would be using would be cheap, so we could make it red, we could make it psychedelic, This would definitely be different enough, you could have a plain black one, you could have sparkly pink glittery ones for your little
this is all about the design of the actual components and the availability of the components we have in stock at the moment. 'cause some of the things that we looked at last time aren't un unfortunately aren't available. This is the chip called the T_A_ double one eight three five which is what's used in pretty much every remote control 'cause it sends out standard signals, based on your input and then we we're loo looking into battery options. There's actually no rechargeable option available, I saw the the standard double A_ and triple A_ which we thought were a bit bit too bulky at the moment, dynamo charging, I thought that that might be a bit silly to be to be honest, So you wind up your remote control before you use it. like the the solar charging, 'cause most people have the light on in the room anyway so they could get when when you got T_V_. I'm pretty sure that solar is from the sun. But I I think I think the the next one's the best anyway. The the kinetic charging which is like you get it in r you get it in wrist watches I mean the amount the amount of probably moving around you'd be doing all the time would would charge it up, it like it runs for long time? well I do I d I'm not entirely sure how long it would last but I've never seen one run out. referring back to solar charging, is that compatible with standard batteries? Ye yeah I think I th g y you could have a dual power thing but the the thing with the solar cells is you would need to put them on the case on a calculator they they're qui they're quite big and they all they all look i identical. Yeah the normal batteries would be the cheapest W w which one would last the longest, because we don't want customers to be like you know charging like a mobile phone every day. 'Cause if we're doing the kinetic thing Shouldn't
and so this feedback from the marketing department is really about trend watching. the methods we used to decide on current trends and so on, market trends, were that we did our traditional our usual market research study with a hundred subjects Also with our company being forerunners in putting fashion into technology, we also looked at a fashion update using our consultants on fashion and design in Paris and Milan. so the general findings from that was in the market trends the most important aspect for remote controls were people want a fancy look and feel, rather than the the current functional look and feel of remote controls. They also also want a remote control to be technologically innovative, and of course, as we predicted, that it should be easy to use. Now I should point out that the first of those findings, fancy look and feel, is the most important, is twice as important as the second, technologically innovative, which is in turn twice as important as being easy to use. we found from our consultants in Paris and Milan who des attended all the design and fashion fairs there, that fruit and vegetables are going to be the theme for clothes, shoes and furniture. There also seems to be a trend towards a spongy feel to materials,
we are going to have m maybe a G_ G_U_I_ interface in the f in the middle of the flip-top we just took the input from the previous meeting, especially from the marketing and industrial design, to check on the customer needs and feasibility. the picture here shows one of the standard models offered by competitors here. So you generally see rectangular shape, very monotonous kind of designs here. And second thing is there's too much of confusion here. basically which is what we d do in computer, have icons or touch pad or whatever, so f on the s simpler board, on the top we have this button, rubber buttons, to keep frequently changing the channels. Can we swap that round so th that the ones that we use all the time are on the bottom part? So the findings are too many cluttered buttons. Repetition of certain but buttons which I already explained, Okay we had a latest finding of voice recognition, there was a mail which mentions that our division has developed a new speech recognition s feature. We have to check into the for financial f feasibility whether we can incorporate it this at a low cost, So it could be like, where is the remote, and the remote answers I am here. so I wouldn't say the design should be like a fruit, but yeah we can take inspiration from fruit colours, like the vibrant colours, red chilli I think most of the users would now be well acquainted with this cer central pattern, here, so we we we would not change h that particular pattern
The the kinetic charging which is like you get it in r you get it in wrist watches I mean the amount the amount of probably moving around you'd be doing all the time would would charge it up, 'Cause if we're doing the kinetic thing Shouldn't we do some market research on that first before we add it in It's not something that's come up in any of our focus groups and market research, But it's something to put on the side to think about maybe. there's the plastic which I think we were gonna go for anyway as the main case case housing so perhaps some something made of rubber,
'cause some of the things that we looked at last time aren't un unfortunately aren't available. There's actually no rechargeable option available,
we had a couple of changes in our plans in that we couldn't use teletext, it wasn't gonna be a control for everything 'cause some of the things that we looked at last time aren't un unfortunately aren't available. There's actually no rechargeable option available,
the minutes from the last time. we had a couple of changes in our plans in that we couldn't use teletext, it wasn't gonna be a control for everything and that we had to incorporate the image of the company into it somehow. we have decided on a leaving out the voice recognition, we've decided on there being a flip design and a different shape from what's normal. We were thinking a shell, but something along those lines, and we were gonna think about the port and an alarm for getting it lost,
The kinetic. so we could incorporate voice recognition for the finding it. I think the only pitfall that we would have would be how much it's going to cost if that means we have to cut down somewhere else, Yeah the well I think were we're going for the L_C_D_ on that one, on the buttons, On the bottom we were gonna have the rubber, the rubber ones,, okay on we've got the flip the flip-screen, the top one is gonna be the L_C_D_ and the bottom one is gonna be the rubberised buttons. so we decided on a rubber casing for the plastic shell, a variety of designs, you could have a plain black one, you could have sparkly pink glittery ones for your little So we can if financially voice recognition is not feasible we could go for a whistle.
Prototype presentation. Me and William worked on a prototype, and I think William is going to make a p presentation on that. I can hold it like and I'll I'll show you the presentation. And we'll first look at the exterior of what we've come up with over there. It's gonna have a a plastic body with a sort of standard colour, either we're thinking some something fairly neutral like a a white or a light blue or something. This is underneath the rubberised the rubberised outer casing which there'd be sort of a wide choice the wide choice of colours and sort of patterns, it's obviously an a sort of clam-shell design and the the top L_C_D_ screen that you can see that would b would be sort of how do you say, it's yeah yeah, it would be sort of inset into the into the top The black and white touch screen and the buttons at the bottom would d so so it'll fully close flat. we've already said d decided on the kinetic batteries, which actually, thinking about it now, could y could also probably attach to the flipping open and shut as well, So put it in the top section rather than the bottom sections, we decided that the voice recognition system, it did actually say on the email that they were sort of coming in and they were fairly easy to get a-hold of, so we presumed that they'd also be quite cheap. So you'd have something like where you'd shout out, where where is the remote and it'll shout back, I'm here, or something. the standard, there's be a standard transmission with the T_V_ using using all the standard chips that we've talked about. obviously 'cause it's split over two two different layers, it would need two separate P_C_B_s, so it would be joined at the hinge through some sort of cabling. And because, obviously, all T_V_s use this, the same infrared medium, we'd just be using using the same thing to transmit the data. And the infrared sender would be on the on one
we decided to use a kinetic charger, standard chip, 'cause it can come in various different sizes, We wanted a stand-by function. The case material is gonna be soft, rubbery, changeable. buttons with a combination of L_C_D_ and rubber according to the design. bright funky designs inspired by fruit, keeping with the hip kind of feel. and to try and incorporate voice recognition software into our design until we can find out more about the cost of things like that. and the rubber buttons that we'll use will be anti-R_S_I_.
but if you take away the voice recognition, then you've got it. If you took away that, that'll make it twelve point three five. We could do the voice recognition for, you know, business class or something, you know, like an upgraded version. I don't see why we have to sell it for twenty five Euros now, because they w they were saying they were quite willing to pay more for better product. We can put in our recommendations. If we if we're working to head office specifications as this is what this project team's working for, we can put in our recommendations for what we've we've found and what we the consensus that we've come to as a result of the meetings. as you say, we can offer the voice recognition initially to business class customers So if we take voice recognition out That'll do it. Twelve point three five. we are close to the budget. Is it twelve point fif was it twelve point fifty? So we are under the budget.
I've got finance here now. We just type numbers into this and we come out with the final value. So are we still on for kinetic? Yeah. See, it woulda been handy to have this at the beginning. it might have influenced our choice. It was a regular chip on print you you've put in three for the number of kinetic cells, there should just be one. one of them and one sample sensor and sample speaker. One double curve. 'cause it's two. what's a single curve then? It would just be a flat bottom with one curve. like a domed thing. we've got plastic and rubber, I think rubber, since it's being used just as a casing, See, it says case material. we're not actually using plastic in the case, There's nowhere else we can code for the the rubber used in the casing. So do we not have to account for it in the cost somewhere there? Or sh we should just put it in as one, because the plastic is zero anyway. special colour, do we need that? Might do, if we go for some of the more exotic aubergines and such like colours. the push-button's one and L_C_ display one. I think we could change the battery also. Instead of going for kinetic how about going for a standard battery. and just actually making the rubber case the curved thing, is that going to make a difference? so the highest we've got is the electronics here. and the interface. If we moved away from our much loved idea of a kinetic battery and just went with the standard batteries, would that make a huge difference? it it would make one difference. What I feel is, customers never said anything about the battery. but if you take away the voice recognition, then you've got it. If you took away that, that'll make it twelve point three five. If we change it to the battery it's that's minus three.
Do we feel on the basis of tha of these evaluation findings that we can go ahead and now produce this as a prototype and market it, or do we have to make further modifications? I don't think so. We happy to go ahead? I think we yeah. I think we're set. I think for most of those ratings that it's high enough at the upper end of the scale for us to go ahead with that, I'll just leave it there. and I really doubt if on the basis of current technology and our current capabilities, we could actually do much more to minimise that.
I've now got evaluation criteria. This stage of the evaluation is really for us as a team to evaluate if we have now got a product specification and prototype design that meets the the criteria that we got from our market research. the collection of the criteria, as we saw in our previous meeting, was based on the user requirements and trends found in the marketing reports and marketing strategy of our company. are we actually meeting those trends and requirements? So it's what we've discussed in the last meeting, The criteria that we want in this remote control are a fancy look and feel, technological innovation, it should be easy to use, it should incorporate current fashion trends, and those the two main ones, they were the spongy texture and the fruit and vegetable strong design colours. The design should minimise R_S_I_ and be easy to locate and we were still slightly ambivalent as to whether to use voice recognition there, though that did seem to be the favoured strategy, We're going to use a seven point scale, where one is true and seven is false. and I will just do a preliminary rating of all those criteria on the whiteboard here. Is it everybody is going to evaluate, or just the Market w we'll discuss each one and we'll come to a consensus rating between one and seven. I won't write all of that out again. It will just be criteria one, two, three, four, five, six, Actually, it might be an idea, if we each did give our own individual rating, and we could take an average at the end. So I'll just separate the ratings by obliques, and if we go one, two, three, four, we know who's who. Criteria A_, the fancy look and feel. My own rating for that would be a two. Two and three quarters? criteria B_, criterion B_, technologically innovative. I would give that a three. I'd give it a one. It's just two point five for that one. ease of use. Based on what you've said there, I would say a
We could do the voice recognition for, you know, business class or something, you know, like an upgraded version. I don't see why we have to sell it for twenty five Euros now, because they w they were saying they were quite willing to pay more for better product. We can put in our recommendations. If we if we're working to head office specifications as this is what this project team's working for, we can put in our recommendations for what we've we've found and what we the consensus that we've come to as a result of the meetings. as you say, we can offer the voice recognition initially to business class customers So if we take voice recognition out That'll do it. Twelve point three five.
we decided that the voice recognition system, it did actually say on the email that they were sort of coming in and they were fairly easy to get a-hold of, so we presumed that they'd also be quite cheap. So you'd have something like where you'd shout out, where where is the remote and it'll shout back, I'm here, or something. though that did seem to be the favoured strategy, Yeah, it was it was a voice voice recognition, And are we happy with the costs on that? That is going to be feasible, cost-wise. Yeah, yeah, that yeah, that's feasible.
There's a final questionnaire. we've got about fifty minutes to catch up with everything that I fell behind with,
If we if we're working to head office specifications as this is what this project team's working for, we can put in our recommendations for what we've we've found and what we the consensus that we've come to as a result of the meetings. with recommendations that they the budget be increased,
We happy to go ahead? I think we yeah. I think we're set. I think for most of those ratings that it's high enough at the upper end of the scale for us to go ahead with that, and I really doubt if on the basis of current technology and our current capabilities, we could actually do much more to minimise that.
And now we've we also decided on the inside, we could possibly either have some some kind of sort of bezzled logo on it, or something inset, or maybe an engraving of the logo on the top.
The black and white touch screen The top screen, as we said, is would be an inset black and white L_C_D_ s touch screen
It's gonna have a a plastic body with a sort of standard colour, either we're thinking some something fairly neutral like a a white or a light blue or something. This is underneath the rubberised the rubberised outer casing the wide choice of colours and sort of patterns, which there'd be sort of a wide choice
I think it's really good that this has been very market research based, because just going back to mobile phones, I mean this is the first change in remote control devices that I can really, you know, say is is obvious and visible. We see it in mobile phones a lot, and tha that's where we've borrowed a lot of our ide our ideas from. There are innovations in that that people don't really want. and I think it's wonderful our company's so R_ and D_ based.
I think we had a nice time. Although we had our separate tasks, there was so much interaction, so much that we needed to bounce off each other. in that in relevant areas we've been able to, you know, give and take and adjust our remit where necessary. Yeah, I think there was very constructive feedback by everybody. We came to a very predic creative design, yeah. And Sarah, you coordinated the work very well. although we didn't quite make the voice recognition in there, but that's that's good. I think it would have made it into the final product if it was actually if if if we'd seen the marketing before the initial specification was put out, I think maybe it would've come out a d little different, I liked the fact that we could say an idea and it'd be suggested that that wasn't the best idea, but no one felt like shot down, you two created that wonderful specimen of a Play-Doh model.
Product evaluation. We've done room for creativity, Because we've got decisions that we would have made that we weren't didn't feel able to make. I presume we discussed leadership and teamwork. Although we had our separate tasks, I think we had a nice time. there was so much interaction, so much that we needed to bounce off each other. in that in relevant areas we've been able to, you know, give and take and adjust our remit where necessary. Yeah, I think there was very constructive feedback by everybody. We came to a very predic creative design, yeah. And Sarah, you coordinated the work very well. although we didn't quite make the voice recognition in there, but that's that's good. I think it would have made it into the final product if it was actually if if if we'd seen the marketing before the initial specification was put out, I think maybe it would've come out a d little different, I liked the fact that we could say an idea and it'd be suggested that that wasn't the best idea, but no one felt like shot down, you two created that wonderful specimen of a Play-Doh model.
and we've got the meeting survey and questionnaire. There's a final questionnaire. we've got about fifty minutes to catch up with everything that I fell behind with,
it might have influenced our choice. See, it woulda been handy to have this at the beginning. with recommendations that they the budget be increased,
our costs are below budget with recommendations that they the budget be increased, Do you think that's takes into account overheads like us being well paid kind of a thing? And the heating for the building, do you think our budget includes everything, all the costs that are going out? I think it was just the produc just the production cost of the phone. I think we've done very well to get within budget
See, it woulda been handy to have this at the beginning. it might have influenced our choice. with recommendations that they the budget be increased,
I'm not exactly clear on what we're designing the rem remote for. Is this a mun multi-functional one I think you just said at the start it was a television remote control, so maybe we should just stick to that unless we get told otherwise. That's true, But at this point in time I think you're right that shall we make it just a T_V_.
Marketing, the user requirement specification.
Work has been done on this project where by twenty five Euros is the expected selling price. So we're looking to sell internationally, not just in Europe. We're looking at having our production costs limited to twelve and an half Euro per unit. And therefore making a profit margin of well not actually a profit margin it's because obviously you're gonna have overheads and various other costs to take from from that to give you your profit margin per unit. And so depending what the the overhead costs are will determine how many units we're looking to sell or projecting to sell at this point in time.
So we've got tool training. Try out whiteboard. Right so everyone's to supposedly draw their favourite animal over on the white board over there. I guess this is make sure the whiteboard works. Do you wish to go f Have a first bash at whatever. I think that I would have to say that my favourite animal is the cat. and I like my animal that looks nothing like a bear because I dunno maybe because there's so many cartoon characters made up after the bear I'm gonna go for the dog, So what my daughters have got at the moment is they've got a few fish and so hopefully won't prove too difficult to draw.
Right, so agenda of the first meeting. Where we We have twenty five minutes for this meeting. So does anyone have any thoughts as to the tool training that is required? so tool training. Project plan. I'm not exactly sure what you mean by tool training. Neither am I. So we have the project team, which is to basically to come up with a new r remote control device. And our idea is to to make the new remote control device more user friendly than the previous one, and to to be trendier, to be with it, and therefore to to get a bigger market share and bigger audience. method of doing this is split up as you can see into the functional design, the conceptional design, and the detailed design in each of these phases we'll basically be handing over to yourselves, the designers of this this device. And having meetings so that we can during the course of the day come up with a better better inst implement than we had before.
We are to get acquainted. So does everyone want to say who they are? I'm Robin. I'm the Marketing Manager. I'm Louisa. I'm the User Interface Designer. I'm Nick. I am the Industrial Designer. And I'm Alastair and I'm the project leader.
Okay, so we've got the working design for I_D_.
I'm not exactly clear on what we're designing the rem remote for. Is this a mun multi-functional one I think you just said at the start it was a television remote control, so maybe we should just stick to that unless we get told otherwise. That's true, 'cause during during the course of our day we might make decisions based on information or meetings that would change where we're going. But at this point in time I think you're right that shall we make it just a T_V_.
Specific instructions will be sent to you by your person by your personal coach. Okay, so we've got the working design for I_D_. For U_I_D_ the technical functions design. Marketing, the user requirement specification.
Experience with remote control, first ideas. New remote. So I guess we're looking at having a discussion at this point in time So any any thoughts? I with some remote controls the buttons were a little small so maybe we make something with easy to press buttons. Okay, so so basically we're looking for some we're looking for a device that is robust and and therefore won't get damaged too easily. sort of easy to use so the buttons are accessible. Because a lot of systems are kind of T_V_ video combined now, Is this just a television remote? or T_V_ D_V_D_ combined. And one of the most annoying things is having like five remotes in the house. So if you've got a combined system, it could be a combined remote. basically I'll get back to you on that. one of the things we found from the market research is that people often get confused by the number of buttons on them as well. Or is it just a television that we're supposed to be doing? 'cause as you rightly said, there's nothing more annoying than having three or four devices littered about the about the room. So a device for for all remotes. And sometimes they sort of remote controls defeat their own purpose because you're sat in the chair and the remote is somewhere else in the room. we need to sort of maybe think about how we could maybe develop a remote control which moves around the room. Comes to your whistle. That's that's maybe something for the future when you can talk to your television, but Maybe we could have better instructions with the remote. I mean we've done some research about sort of you know what the cutting edge sort of hand held devices are, You can't have both the th the one device and then have few buttons on it to 'cause you want you want simplicity as well, Whilst at the same time you want, as you rightly said, one remote for all. And so these are probably mutually exclusive options you could argue
For U_I_D_ the technical functions design.
Well, if we're trying to keep it slee sleek and sexy as well, have you seen those remotes where kind of the bottom bit slides down, so there's kind of everything else revealed? So you don't use it that much, That is that is a good idea actually. So so keep keep detailed functions hidden at the back. And that'll be better for the older generation as well So we're gonna have to have to work out what's gonna be on these other functions as as well. The detailed ones would be sort of brightness, And then at the back? You've got brightness and contrast. Maybe if we're gonna run out of time, one of us should come up with a list of these and then get back at the next meeting just at the start and say what they're gonna be. there's audio functions. You're also gonna have the channel tuner, as it were. And then maybe sort of an enter button for sort of s you know, saying that you want that particular thing tuned in.
Well shall we look into that and just get back together.
Well, so maybe a clap rather than a whistle would be On the basis that if we've got if we're catering to the whole age range, you want something that's easy to do, clapping, I think clapping,
and then the the little digit next to it which kind of enabled you to put them together. I'll put delay to allow multiple numbers.
So so keep keep detailed functions hidden at the back.
The detailed ones would be sort of brightness, So on front, about the number. the volume up and down. A mute button as well. And probably a power one as well. So so are you having the stand-by on the front, then? are we gonna have the channel up and down as well as the number buttons? 'cause yeah the market research said there is quite a lot of people do just zap around and flick, so. volume is twelve, Numbers is ten, And a mute, yeah. And then at the back? You've got brightness and contrast. there's audio functions. You're also gonna have the channel tuner, as it were. And then maybe sort of an enter button for sort of s you know, saying that you want that particular thing tuned in.
So anything that is to be added, such as voice recognition et cetera has to be very simple and has to be very quick and it seems to me that the management is wanting us to go down a narrow path and not opening out. because time to market is is critical. S But probably quick and simple is primary rather than added extras. d d I think I think first and foremost we've gotta get to the end and then get to the end with added extras if possible.
so we've got new project requirements. So basically we've got three things, and we've got forty minutes in which to for this meeting to to discuss the various options. W I I got or or three things basically, relating to the remote being only for T_V_. We discussed that last time we've got teletext outdated. Right and the corporate image was the final thing. So I I got that in email form.
so having researched the existing models within the market, I found my research off the internet. I've established what the components required for the remote control to function, actually are. And then also the methods in which these components interact together for the remote to actually do what you want it to do the basic components are an energy source which I guess in most existing models would be a battery supply. there's also a chip inside the remote which does all the computer type things. And then the sender, which is usually, I've found, an infra-red device which sends a signal to the actual television. a power supply we then have a particular button, that's obviously there's lots and lots of different buttons. after you press that that sends the message to the chip, and then sends the appropriate message to the sender. that's the components of the remote
Okay I'm gonna be looking at the working design. I've just got three sections, first is the research I made on the on the remote control itself. And then that involves the components required in it and the systems design of the actual the actual remote. so having researched the existing models within the market, I found my research off the internet. I've established what the components required for the remote control to function, actually are. And then also the methods in which these components interact together for the remote to actually do what you want it to do the basic components are an energy source which I guess in most existing models would be a battery supply. We then have the user interface, which is basically the like the the buttons on the actual remote. the various functions used for changing channel, channel up and down, volume, things like that. there's also a chip inside the remote which does all the computer type things. And then the sender, which is usually, I've found, an infra-red device which sends a signal to the actual television. and the last part is receiver which is important in the system because that's obviously found in the television. I'm gonna have to actually draw on the board because it was a little tricky on PowerPoint to get this working, a power supply we then have a particular button, that's obviously there's lots and lots of different buttons. after you press that that sends the message to the chip, and then sends the appropriate message to the sender. that's the components of the remote So this is the user interface. And then on the separate thing we have on the on the television we have a a receiver. which then, and that's the that's the infra-red sender. going on to personal preferences, I've said that battery seems the best option for the actual remote, just because of the size. and infra-red has been used quite successfully. and then the sender,
and it seems to me that the management is wanting us to go down a narrow path and not opening out. So anything that is to be added, such as voice recognition et cetera has to be very simple and has to be very quick because time to market is is critical. S But probably quick and simple is primary rather than added extras. d d I think I think first and foremost we've gotta get to the end and then get to the end with added extras if possible.
. Okay so I'm gonna talk a bit about the technical functions design. so the m basic method of this is to send a signal from the remote to the television set, so that a desired function is performed. here are two example remotes. by the look of it they both have kind of play and fast forward, rewind functions, so I think they incorporate a kind of video function which we won't have to worry about. but as you can see, the left remote is quite quite busy looking, quite complicated. whereas the right remote is much simpler, it looks much more user friendly. so my personal preference would be the right remote. it's got a very limited number of buttons. So, it's got nice big buttons, I like the use of the kind of symbols like the triangles and the squares and the arrows as well as the words on the kind of play functions and all that. So it's very very user friendly, But I got I got an email that basically said to make sure that whatever device we come up with at the end of the day had to incorporate the corporate colour and slogan. we have to remember that we have our own logo and colour scheme.
But we have to make the decisions on the remote control functions and how we were planning to proceed so that at the next meeting each person that's got a a a task to do is clear from this meeting what that task is. Well, so maybe a clap rather than a whistle would be On the basis that if we've got if we're catering to the whole age range, you want something that's easy to do, Well I think it'd be really easy and it'd be a big advantage if we did have some sort of kind of whistle back kind of function. I don't really know about the voice recognition thing. clapping, I think clapping, 'Kay we've already decided that we don't need a teletext button, haven't we? Did we decide on having the ten the ten numbers and then the the little digit next to it which kind of enabled you to put them together. I think nowadays you can just get ones where it gives you a sort of a second or two to press another number, I'll put delay to allow multiple numbers. we could possibly put an L_ a sort of a L_C_D_ menu in, but that again is probably an expense that you only have to probably tune in the T_V_ once, So and if finally the T_V_ breaks, you get a new one, you're gonna have to be able to tune it. the the product we've got is something that's at the I would have said the lower end of the s of the cost scale, so we're not really going for something that's terribly high-tech. I mean we're maybe talking about replacing remotes for slightly older televisions, so we maybe need to keep the the tuning function in. Would you maybe have like one menu button, then you'd use the other buttons, maybe the number buttons to actually do the separate functions. Yeah, 'cause you do need kind of brightness and contrast and everything as well. Well, if we're trying to keep it slee sleek and sexy as well, have you seen
going on to personal preferences, I've said that battery seems the best option for the actual remote, just because of the size. and infra-red has been used quite successfully. and then the sender,
Well, so maybe a clap rather than a whistle would be On the basis that if we've got if we're catering to the whole age range, you want something that's easy to do, clapping, I think clapping, and then the the little digit next to it which kind of enabled you to put them together. I think nowadays you can just get ones where it gives you a sort of a second or two to press another number, I'll put delay to allow multiple numbers.
we've done some research into the functional requirements that people want out of their remote control. and how do people use it? We asked them sort of which buttons were useful for them. And we did that by sort of giving them a questionnaire that we'd prepared and asking them to fill in the answers. And three quarters of them found that remote controls are ugly and that a sort of even higher proportion would spend more for a sort of s a fancier remote control And that of all the buttons on the remote control, the sort of setting buttons for sort of the picture picture and brightness and the audio settings, they weren't used very often at all. People concentrated on the channel buttons and the volume buttons and the power buttons. we also asked them about speech recognition for remote control. And young people were quite receptive to this, but as soon as we got sort of over about into a thirty five to forty age forty five age group and older, people people weren't quite so keen on speech recognition. There's a lot more th there's a lot lot more older people who didn't know whether they wanted it or not as well. and the number one frustration was that the remote was lost somewhere else in the room and that they couldn't find it. And the second second biggest frustration what that if they got a new remote control, it was difficult to learn all the buttons and all the functions, and to find your way around it. My personal preferences from the marketing is that we need to come up with some sort of sleek sort of good looking high high-tech and that we should come up with fewer buttons than most of the controls on the market, and we should sort of concentrate on the channels and sort of power, and also volume and that sort of thing, as as Louisa said.
Would you be able to get rid of the the extra buttons here, the the sort of circular section, because that seems to be for a video as well. So we could dispense with that little bit as well and just get it down to just the numbers and the volume. And I don't really think that you need nine numbers. I mean how often do you use seven, eight and nine? I think just one to six and then channel up and down should be enough. Well for for general television purposes obviously you have channels one to five at this point in time, and we'd have to have some room for future such channels. but the the other thing is that with the current expansion of channels in the process of taking place, certainly the button up and down, and there's I don't know exactly how many channels there are on when you take into account Sky and various other various others. Maybe you could have a fast forward on the on the channels some remotes have kind of favourite options Yeah, I s I suppose in a sense you could have if you've got a hundred channels then if you had sort of an easy way of getting rather than having to go one to a hundred, you could go one to one to ten, ten to twenty and then have a second button to get you to the actual channel you want But I think a lot of like Cable and Sky and stuff, that would be tuned to one channel, and then you'd have another remote for all of those channels. Limit the number of buttons, But I suppose nine's not really excessive. you could get fifty by five and a zero or whatever, How many buttons have we got? We've just got ten, eleven twelve th Well we've we've got that it's remote for T_V_ only otherwise project would become too complex with which would endanger the time to market was one of the considerations.
And possibly the thing about the about the remote being lost we could have You know with your mobile phone, you lose that and you can ring it. Maybe we can have some kind of sensor which is kept somewhere where you can some kind of buzzer system between the two. So you can press a button which is always kept in one place and then it maybe buzzes to somewhere else, wherever the remote actually is. Yeah, we'd have t that would mean we'd have to put two products together as well, There's key rings that you kind of whistle at or clap at, and then they whistle back, or something like that. That'd probably be really simple, or like the same technology could be put inside the inside the remote. Well if you're trying to avoid having a second product 'cause obviously you could have a second product that gave you the right pitch which would set the remote off to say here I am sort of thing, you know without sound recognition. I mean obviously if you've got voice recognition then you can do it in that way I was gonna say a sharp noise, you know a clapping of hand or whatever. a set command whatever that happened to be. and you can give it a command, because it'll recognise the voice you could have an option to turn it off. Or So that would solve the problems with the T_V_ kind of speaking to the remote and changing its own channels. would it take quite a while to sort of develop the speech recognition software in the remote control? Well if it does then we can't.
we could maybe come up with a menu, a sort of a an L_C_D_ menu for other functions on the remote control. and maybe we could think about speech recognition as well, because sort of young people are perhaps the ones that are gonna buy buy our new product if we aim it at sort of you know sort of a high-tech design. And we could maybe think about using speech recogniti recognition as a way to find the remote control if it's lost in a room, rather than sort of having it to speech recognition to change the channels. 'Cause there's a problem with that in that the television makes noise, so it could end up talking to itself and changing its channel. What was that last wee bit there? about speech recognition? But that was only for young people that preferred it, older people didn't. and they might end up costing more than our twelve fifty budget for for the speech recognition..
okay, so very brief presentation,. From looking at the remotes that are out there at the minute, none of them are particularly sleek and sexy. I haven't actually got the examples of the scroll button there, but there's some curved cases that you can see, a range of sizes. All of them have a lot of buttons there some of the remotes that I looked at, one of the models da did actually have voice recognition where you could where it was connected to the remote control functions. And it was quite a swish model, I mean maybe it's better not to try and compete with that sort of thing the scroll buttons, as you've already mentioned, there's examples of those, but they don't look as sleek as other models. and because it impacts on other on the materials and the price it's not great. Th there was a specialist type of remote that we could think about,. There was children's remote, where they just had a very limited range of buttons and they were b bright and colourful and you you could program them so that they could only look at certain channels. Well we're to go for the international market rather than a local market The one thing that you can often do with products is you can make small modifications. So you have your basic model which you would sell at whatever, and then you could have additional features You'd have model one, model two and model three, So maybe the children's remote should be like a a next step, and that you would have for future reference the possibility of adding in extra features at extra cost to take care of specialist market segments.
So I don't think it would effect our circuit board. But the way that I interpret that it doesn't seem to send out a signal to the telly, it's like a parrot just rep reply replying to your message. so we'd have a simple circuit board And I don't think you could really perform any of the remote functions with it. so we'd stick with the simple circuit board Are we going for speech recognition? Just just for the call and find thing. It's it's just an addition thing but Maybe we maybe we'll find out how much that does cost and have to decide slightly later.
that's a that's a decision for all of us.. So are we able to make that decision now in a sense that this is the point at which we're discussing that issue, I mean one way is to do each of the presentations and then make decisions going back to the various presentations as they were. that's probably a better one, to discuss it straight away. so if we wanted to know for instance that the scroll wheel required the regular and what required advance. Then if we were able to see that down then we could make the decision at that point in time As I say it only specified that we need a more advanced circuit board for the scroll wheel, The voice recognition came as a separate piece of information.. the scroll wheel required the regular, The display requires an advanced chip And note that the push button just requires a simple chip, Yeah, and if we're going for sleek and sexy, I think a scroll wheel is maybe a bit kinda bulky? So maybe just a simple push button, Yeah, a simple pushbuttons. Did everyone get this on the speech recognition? So it is basically the concept we discussed before. but then we don't know for sure whether it would require a more complicated circuit board. So if we go for the simple push button, so effectively we're going for the simple printed circuit board are we? I suppose we need we need to find out what circuit board that requires, maybe before we m make a decision. But the way that I interpret that it doesn't seem to send out a signal to the telly, it's like a parrot just rep reply replying to your message. So I don't think it would effect our circuit board. so we'd have a simple circuit board And I don't think you could really perform any of the remote functions with it. so we'd stick with the simple circuit board W w kinetic. I I thought so just for just for ease of not having to replace the batteries. Somehow
So if we've got the scroll wheel for one of the buttons, that would require a slightly more advanced circuit board than if we just had a standard push button. So if we wanted the scroll wheel and wanted the voice recognition, then we'd have to get a a more costly circuit board. and for the circuit board, again depends on which features we want in the actual in the remote. if we're gonna have the speech recognition, we'd have to probably get an advanced one. I'm guessing. but I don't know, so that is something I'll have to look into.
For the components design, next step is basically the the way the remote's gonna work is still the same idea as before. We still have the user interface which is all the buttons we're gonna incorporate. Then there is a chip and still the sender. So yes including the power s supply as well. first in the power supply, we have the option of just the standard battery, There's a dynamo. There's a kinetic option, which would mean the batteries wouldn't have to be replaced. but I think that was gonna cost a little more. And then there's solar cells. as a final option. For the buttons, we have an integrated push button, which I guess is just the same as the standard ones. This says it's similar to the button on the mouse for a normal for like like modern computer. there's a scroll wheel which is you know the new mouse has just got like the centre section which you can scroll up and down, one issue for the buttons is, depending on which material we use, if we use rubber buttons then it requires a rubber case, What would be the cost do do we know? I th I think the there wasn't too much difference in the cost, that that related to the actual buttons, but it does affect the printed circuit board. The firm supplies a simple, a regular and an advanced circuit board. So if we've got the scroll wheel for one of the buttons, that would require a slightly more advanced circuit board than if we just had a standard push button. one final thing we came up with was some information on the speech recognition. There's a small unit available through the company which obviously would be an extra cost, going to my personal preferences, I thought possibly for power we could use kinetic And this would avoid batteries running out, having to replace batteries and such like. for the buttons, I thought we'd probably get away with just having the standard push buttons rather than the scroll wheel. So if we wanted
Right well from the last meeting I was trying to send you the minutes, but it didn't work out too well, so maybe in sort of quick summary of the last meeting, I can quickly give you what we what we had. Right so we had the fact that we're gonna have the the logo the company logo in its colour scheme incorporated onto the the device the remote device. We had made our decisions about made our decisions about the device itself, that it was gonna be simple to make it enable us to complete the project in time. We're gonna have effectively two pages, a front page which had the features that the the customers most wanted, and then the the backup features on the second page so that it could meet the technical requirements.
So maybe just a simple push button, Yeah, a simple pushbuttons. Alright, so we're just gonna have the the rubber buttons, So did we did we decide on the kinetic power supply?
I guess you two are on plasticine duty or whatever.
I think because there's already very good voice recognition technology out there, and because ours might not cover the same functions that the leading brands do, it might be a good idea to market it as a finder function. the finder function rather than as a speech function to find your remote. and and the voice recognition, we can use that can't we, just to find it. Without affecting the circuit board.
I've I've got some things to say about possible design things from trend watching. Right, I've been looking at some trends in in sort of basically fashion on top of doing the research into the remote control market that we'd sort of asked people about remote controls and what what was good about them, what was bad, what they used. And we've also been looking at sort of fa sort of fashions and what people are wanting out of consumer goods at the moment. So we've had people in Paris and Milan watching the fashion trends. The most important thing was that the thing sort of look and felt fancy rather than just functional. And second, there should be some technological innovation. And then third and l less important than the other two, there should be an ease of use as well. And apparently, the fashion trends are that people want sort of clothes and shoes and things with a fruit and vegetables theme. but the feel of the material should be spongy, we need to emphasise the fancy design with on on our remote control above all else. And then also try and add in technological informat innovation which could be our sort of find the thing with a hand clap. And then maybe find a way to incorporate these trends so that we sort of capture people's imaginations. So maybe we could make the buttons shaped like fruit and veg, or the the buttons could be spongy, somehow. And then sort of even wackier than that, we could maybe have a fruit or vegetable shaped remote, How how far we actually want to go along and sort of follow the trends, do we think the trends are particularly important for this type of gadget, or or you know, do they not matter that much?
say the standby button is quite kinda separate from all the other functions. Maybe that could be a little apple. And then are we going for sort of one button shaped like a fruit. Or veg. Could be a red apple, yeah.
so we'd stick with the simple circuit board
there was a mention just as kind of a warning about button design. just to avoid ambiguity. I think the thing was that if you decide to do this, to have triangular buttons, somebody might look at this one and say oh well this triangular button is pointing up, they might see yeah, they might see this pointing down and think right that's gonna turn the volume down, whereas the actual button's pointing up, so the function is to turn the button up. So, be careful what you put on the buttons and be careful of the shape that you make them, because they might be kind of two contradicting kind of shapes. So maybe we could have volume written on the side
Th there was a specialist type of remote that we could think about,. There was children's remote, where they just had a very limited range of buttons and they were b bright and colourful and you you could program them so that they could only look at certain channels. Well we're to go for the international market rather than a local market The one thing that you can often do with products is you can make small modifications. So you have your basic model which you would sell at whatever, and then you could have additional features You'd have model one, model two and model three, So maybe the children's remote should be like a a next step, but on this basic one I'm reckoning that we're going for the basic model to be discussed here and that you would have for future reference the possibility of adding in extra features at extra cost to take care of specialist market segments.
but on this basic one I'm reckoning that we're going for the basic model to be discussed here
I think if you start making the buttons fruit shaped, it might make it more complicated to use. Well you were just talking about you've got to be careful how you shape your buttons, Maybe just one button, I mean it just seems realistic that the remote control market isn't the kind of thing which takes in those kinds of fashion trends. to something which is maybe more universal. But I suppose as long as it's quite a subtle design, Maybe the spongy feel is something we could think about,. Maybe still with a rubber design we could The m the main problem is how f how frequently do the fashions change? Whereas if you kept the product the same but you could have a difference from year to year, it seems to me that you could incorporate a fashion statement if you like, rather than changing the whole kit and caboodle. You're just changing one aspect like like the standby button or something like that, I suppose we maybe are limited in the fact that we still have to put the logo on the actual Maybe we could think of the the cases like changing with the fashions like the Nokia phones where you could take the casing off the outside. Oh but you still would have to have the logo on every new case, But we are supposed to use the company colour scheme, aren't we? You could have your company badge and logo. I mean a lot of computers for instance like like on the one you've got there, it actually has a sort of stick on badge And whether we'd have a big enough market to have this kind of like secondary market of selling the cases might be something to consider. I'm not convinced on whether having changeable covers would be something that people would buy into. Okay, so if we just went for one colour of a rubber case whereas just the fact that it was a rubber case is probably less less of something that y you're gonna end up hating in a year
I mean a lot of computers for instance like like on the one you've got there, it actually has a sort of stick on badge You could have your company badge and logo.
say the standby button is quite kinda separate from all the other functions. Maybe that could be a little apple. th that that incorporates the trend whilst at the same time not confusing people, if you're looking for functionality. If y if you change all the buttons then you've got the problem that this year's fruit and veg, next year's I was gonna say animals or elephants or w whatever. It seems like you're gonna have rubber cases, as well as buttons. Rubber buttons require rubber case. Okay, so if we just went for one colour of a rubber case whereas just the fact that it was a rubber case is probably less less of something that y you're gonna end up hating in a year, you know. it seems to make sense that we we'd just maybe stick with the standard rubber case, and then have the standard rubber buttons as well. Maybe curves give it like the slightly more aesthetic feel? But the double curve wouldn't require us to perform miracles with the Plasticine. one thing to consider is that in some ways you want by having a fairly standard case it means they can all fit together on top of each other therefore for storage purposes in shops and the like and it makes it easier that you can if you can store them up on top of each other. Shall we go for single curve, just to compromise? We'll go for single curve, yeah. And then are we going for sort of one button shaped like a fruit. Or veg. so it's not really spongy feel buttons, it's just rubber buttons. Could be a red apple, yeah. Yeah 'cause we wanna incorporate a bit of colour if we can, 'Cause most of them will just be kind of mainly circular or like very plain. just to keep the shape of the buttons simple.
It seems like you're gonna have rubber cases, as well as buttons. Rubber buttons require rubber case. Shall we go for single curve, just to compromise? We'll go for single curve, yeah. And the rubber push buttons, rubber case. Yeah 'cause we wanna incorporate a bit of colour if we can,
And the speech feature.
Okay, so, by the fact that we've got the simple chip and the kinetic energy source, we've got a single curved case. We've got a rubber case materials supplements.
So we're now on to project process. Now satisfaction with, for example, room for creativity, leadership, teamwork, means, et cetera, whiteboard, digital pens, et cetera. I suppose the easiest way of doing it is to put some notes down, which I will do. Did you feel you got a chance to express yourselves well enough? I thought some of the divisions though between sort of the individual meetings were a bit arbitrary. Well, we were finding out various things in in be in-between the meetings, and they didn't the one meeting didn't always follow on for the other one, you know, sort of we had things thrown in at the second meeting where, you know, you'd looked at the remote controls and seen the curviness, but in the first one you'd also looked at some remote controls and looked at the buttons, and I don't understand why it would be in separate meetings that you'd do that. The only thing you find is in a manufacturing process, you would normally, you go to a meeting, you decide, right, you do this, you do that, you do that. Then you go away. You find out information. You then come back. You then discuss it. Whereas, this time, you're really getting it from a database source, what do you want to put down? Creativity, seemed okay. flow of information on on any given subject given subject sometimes disjointed. I think it maybe could have been a slightly more creative project. It was quite good with this the white board, having that and the digital pens. so how do you reckon teamwork went? That went okay, yeah. I guess we all had separate ideas and then discussed them. To go reasonably well.
If you have a in plastic rather than rubber, then that would enable you to get you could keep kinetic then, you could keep your sample sensor, which gets us In right within the budget range. and then we could make sure we definitely had all the button supplements. Yeah, I was I was thinking that because maybe maybe the sort of rubber case is a bit less in sort of the corporate identity than the sort of you know sleeker plastic case. So we're going for plastic, yes? Oh actually we just have a plastic case, then we lose two points, we've got nought point eight left, Well, we've got special form. Now that would be one button, and the question was was that all buttons or is that just one button. 'Cause our plan really was to have one button only with a special I guess we'd have the ones which are blue at the moment would would just be the standard colour. So, special colour, you want three in there. Well I thin I think you you you just need two for the special colour One original colour and then sort of two supplements, I think maybe. Maybe that'll be a second supplement. the volume ones should stand out a bit. You were making these buttons down the bottom, I was presuming, bigger than the other ones, And we've got special form is the one apple. Then there's a spe a second special form. Yeah, that's twelve point three, So I think that should still be okay. Well, in this one, you've actually got three colours of buttons. we've got point two to play with if you really wanted to. Well, we decided that the blue ones were the the standard colour.
we did find a new idea, I mean sort of a kinetic remote control. voice recognition, especially not could You've got voice recognition computers, that's not remote controls. Yeah, so it's just like the same products, but just put together in a different way. New ideas found, so one or two. Kinetic powered remote control., Voice recognition thing.
I think it maybe could have been a slightly more creative project. I mean a remote control isn't the most kind of fancy thing that you could imagine designing. But think like it was a bit restrictive just to say that you have to design a television remote control, in a way. I mean this one seems. From the website it looks it's quite innovative, I don't think sort of the budget allowed us to do anything Bit bit arbitrary. Well, I mean I don't think it I just don't think it fitted in with the rest of their products.
So, we've all got a note of it's thirteen point seven, isn't it, with everything we want on.
Okay, so, by the fact that we've got the simple chip and the kinetic energy source, we've got a single curved case. We've got a rubber case materials supplements. I switching around those th on the electronics we got the sample sensor.
and we evaluate the prototype against some criteria that we've formulated. And do that on a scale from say true being one and false being seven, So, I got a set of criteria just based on the marketing that we need to add in a financial one as well, at the end. so, We have to say whether it's true or false that the product looks and feels fancy. The whether the product demonstrates technical innovation. Whether it's easy to use. Whether it's incorporating sort of the fashion element to attract the buyer. And whether it's a sort of recognisable Real Reaction product. And I have to go up onto the whiteboard and do this apparently, So the first one is, does the product look and feel fancy. Okay, well we have a single curve,, then we have the rubber kinda spongy feel, which was in at the time. Yeah, I'd maybe give it a a two. What Is one false, or is t one true? One's true. So say about a two for fancy, And I mean, how much does the product demonstrate technical innovation do you reckon?, deciding between the kinetic power or the speech recognition, and if we had either of those for our budget, they both show a reasonable amount of speech recognition. we've got we've got the speech recognition on it, haven't we. So it says if we make a slightly more fancy, then we lose points innovation, and if we make it more innovative innovative, then we lose points on it being fancy, so I would go for a one on that at this point in time., incorporates elements of fashion to attract buyer. it's got the cherry and the sponginess. Say about a three maybe? The product is a recognisable real r reaction product? I woulda said two would seem reasonable. and it's got a fairly big label on the bottom saying where it comes from. So this is about sort of the corporate image of like new sort of sleek technology and all that sort of thing, as well as having the logo
Shall we shall we evaluate the prototype as we've got it now first, and then sort of make decisions about what needs to be changed after?
So we're going for plastic, yes?
Well, but you've got the company logo on there, which would effectively be a stick-on badge. Whether whether that's considered to be sort of part of the corporate identity, I don't know.
Y no, it's a slightly curved around the sides. Cherry would be alright actually. We also have a apple slash cherry design at the top. Yeah, and cherries are fun, summery. And did we make it a cherry officially? Yeah. Okay, so, by the fact that we've got the simple chip and the kinetic energy source, we've got a single curved case. We've got a rubber case materials supplements.
it's got the cherry and the sponginess. And that would sort of maybe keep us close on the sort of the fashion type one. Maybe other ones could be something else shaped. So it's w if we've if we've put in for another special form on a button, then maybe they could be a different shape. Yeah, I mean the volume buttons could be lemons or something, maybe.
Well we've made our prototype anyway. You pass it round to have a look. Y no, it's a slightly curved around the sides., it's almost curved like up to the main display as well. And the little line at the bottom indicates the bit the panel that you pull down. And the extra function buttons are below that panel on the little line. We also have a apple slash cherry design at the top. Cherry would be alright actually. Yeah, and cherries are fun, summery. For the first time, well it was hard to get the h the actual labelling on the individual buttons., we just chose simple shapes for all them., the important ones are the volume ones. So we made them a bit bigger. Hum, you separate off in colour the volume related buttons from the channel related buttons, so you've got the volume in orange on design there, and the the channel is in blue. And so when I done my thing on cost a I had assumed that the only button that would be a different colour would be the the red apple button. so but there would be a cost implication on that, Well the colours wouldn't like that's they wouldn't be too important, but we didn't have any white Play-Doh. Yes, we'll have the slide-away.
, don't forget to complete final questionnaire and meeting summary. I think that we've got two questionnaires and a report on the last meeting.
So decide we've lost a little bit on the fashion and lost a bit on the fancy kinda side of it, How much of a difference would it make if we made the case in plastic? If the buttons are rubber that might be spongy enough. So we're going for plastic, yes? Lose a little bit on the fashion, yeah, but
, well we've still got the kinetic energy.
Yeah, I mean the volume buttons could be lemons or something, maybe. well, we could have lemon shaped ones with the volume ones or something.
well, we could have lemon shaped ones with the volume ones or something.
Well, we decided that the blue ones were the the standard colour. I think if they were just all small round blue buttons, it'd be fine.
Did you get told what the company colour is or I'm still not quite sure we've established that. so long as our company's logo is framed w in the same way as that with a like a black outline. So basically, even if you had a silver the same colour of silver on your display, because you've got effectively a double edging on the on the logo, it means that it splits off what your logo is from the from the product.
I think another thing that would help is if it beeps when you clap, Well or yeah or if it's really, if it's really in a dark spot that it gives out a a sound or a signal.
And and it should have multi-purpose. Yes, I I feel that all the remote should be very compact. Like the remote control which we use for T_V_, it shou it should be used f for some other purpose also, like controlling the temperature inside the house or for air-conditioners, or for heating system. Yeah, design should be, yeah it should be different.
Like the remote control which we use for T_V_, it shou it should be used f for some other purpose also, like controlling the temperature inside the house or for air-conditioners, or for heating system. At twelve fifty Euros per Well who knows if we get a really good designer maybe we can do that.
Yeah, my name is Francina. And I'm an user interface And I'm a marketing person. My name is Eileen. Yeah. I'm Jeanne-Oui. my role is industrial designer And as you already know I am Betty. I am the project manager for today.
I think the first thing we do is introduce ourselves and everybody's name and what your function is? Yeah, my name is Francina. And I'm an user interface And I'm a marketing person. My name is Eileen. Yeah. I'm Jeanne-Oui. my role is industrial designer And as you already know I am Betty. I am the project manager for today.
I think another thing that would help is if it beeps when you clap, Well or yeah or if it's really, if it's really in a dark spot that it gives out a a sound or a signal. maybe it should have a light so that we can, we can just recognise where it is. and I I think voice or clapping it's not specific enough.
It should be something new it should be s it it should do something different than than just what we have. Yeah, design should be, yeah it should be different. Maybe it should different colours or materials or you know.
The industrial designer That's you. working design, yeah, it's it's mainly technical-functional design.
Yes, I I feel that all the remote should be very compact. And and it should have multi-purpose. Like the remote control which we use for T_V_, it shou it should be used f for some other purpose also, like controlling the temperature inside the house or for air-conditioners, or for heating system.
The industrial designer That's you. working design, yeah, it's it's mainly technical-functional design. so so you are the working design. So you have a working design and then a functional design. And the marketing manager is coming up with some user requirement specification, like friendliness, and what we just discussed in general. I think basically basically you will get instructions to work with Then we see you in about thirty minutes.
Here's the project finance selling price is supposed to be twenty five Euro. profit aim for the company is fifty million Euro, the market range unlimited meaning international and the production cost should not exceed hopefully should be less than twelve fifty Euro. now having used a remote control for years does anybody already have like an idea like things you didn't like with it, things you would like to change, things you would like to improve with this thing
And the marketing manager is coming up with some user requirement specification, like friendliness, and what we just discussed in general.
Then, tool training try out the white board, participant can draw their favourite animal. You wanna go Eileen and And remember you have to press so it works.
so so you are the working design. So you have a working design and then a functional design.
Here is what the functional design is supposed to achieve. That is it's gonna be individual work and then at the meeting we'll discuss what we have come up with. The same goes for the conceptual design, Detailed design, same thing basically.
profit aim for the company is fifty million Euro,
This thing we are gonna design is a new remote control. should be original, trendy, and, of course, user friendly.
selling price is supposed to be twenty five Euro.
the one thing for example something to eliminate maybe that's the teletext,
and the third thing that they wanna make sure that their that the corporate image is being maintained, and that the corporate colour and design are being used on the product,
and it looks to me that within the budget that we're looking at the the whole house idea really isn't gonna be possible. At the budget that we're looking at and at the price point we're looking at, we should be able to make it work the T_V_, the V_C_R_, the stereo set maybe something else cute like a coffee pot or one other appliance or maybe a lamp.
can we is it even feasible to make one one remote control with something for everyone, or would we have to use the same electronics and make three different shapes? Well we may have to come back to one or two of these points at our next meeting but If we do some more research, maybe we. If money permits we can address some features for some subgroups within that.
If money permits we can address some features for some subgroups within that. Do we agree on on that in principle, like money will tell whether we will be able to do that or not.
but the target group as a whole is is basically everybody with a T_V_. I I think to sum it up the target group is basically everybody.
Now, talking about the target group which is in a sense everybody, but I think within the target group we have subgroups. we have earlier it was mentioned about for example elderly people who have limited function with their fingers and hands, And I don't know how much we want to cater to children's use. and I dunno what you feel about whether we can just say we have one target group and for this one target group we're gonna design this one thing So if you've designed something that's very attractive to children the mummy please mummy please you know we want it now we wanna go to the store and see it that has a lot of marketing pull. I think the children issue can be addressed with the shape and with colours. The question is only whether our budget will allow to have more than one design in a sense. but the target group as a whole is is basically everybody with a T_V_. They have like removable plastic cases, so you can have a striped one or you can have a fluorescent blue one, or whatever, that in each package you know you have you you have you have for example you have let's say a fluorescent blue on it but then you have another colour or stripe whatever that already comes in a package.
And different shapes that we can do like we can have you know a all animals shapes or you know comfortable whi which can fit into your hands you you say that won't add too much to the budget? No no no, it won't I don't think it will be like, Do you think there's any chance of having ser in having basically the same machine with the same buttons but maybe several different shapes? Because we had something sort of sexy for adults and we could have something sort of Silly for children. so I think we need to make some buttons which are which are like f in in intended for two or three operations, And and the butto buttons also I think if you want to have more features in your remote controller then there should be more buttons. because I think there's a lot of argument to be made for one button for one feature. So maybe having buttons be various shapes might be a help too. You know, like the a triangle is for the volume and a square is for changing channels, so that people can develop a tactile sense of it. And display clock i if you want more features then we can display a clock
so today I'm going to talk about the working design of the remote controller. in a remote controller you have a chip integrated circuit which is like a brain of the remote controller. It takes the power from a battery and it takes the input and it it transforms into a infro infrared bits and it sends it into the device, like a T_V_ or a air conditioner, something like that so. and so I think it's hard to design a remote controller for multiple devices. Yeah well that's already been eliminated by management, so we're off the hook. So user interface controls the chip and accordingly the messages it's like el the text or buttons which which are there on the remote controller they those we can make like fluorescent if suppose a child is playing with the remote controller and a and she she or he is pressing the buttons all at the time then there should be a beep saying that it's this this is not a a you know a a action, there can be no action taking to that so. like you should be able to lock your remote controller so that whatever buttons are pressed by a child they can't be like y you i you if you have ki kids and all then they'll be pl playing with the remote controllers so can lock the remote controller. And different shapes that we can do And of course there should be a case where we can keep all the things
alright now other things that I found out on in my research is that the complaints that people have about the remote controls that are out there now. 'Cause a lot of them take too much time to learn how to use, but even more important the thing that we did address in our last meeting that frequently it's lost somewhere in the room. we wanna s make it as simple as possible, we wanna make it obvious and intuitive to use, we talked about the a light emitting thing as well as maybe a beep, Okay, so, my personal preferences in this project are really have to concentrate on the sizzle. We have to have as few buttons as possible, because more buttons is more confusion, So we've gotta concentrate on the features that help you find it, and then maybe a motto, like we put fashion in electronics might be something we can use in our marketing campaign.
okay, can can I at this point interject something? we have received instruction from higher up that certain things should not be considered. the one thing for example something to eliminate maybe that's the teletext, and according to to higher management the it should only control the T_V_, and the third thing that they wanna make sure that their that the corporate image is being maintained, and that the corporate colour and design are being used on the product,
If we do some more research, maybe we. If money permits we can address some features for some subgroups within that. Do we agree on on that in principle, like money will tell whether we will be able to do that or not. So now I understand it's lunch break.
However the decision we have to take in this meeting is who is our target group. And what function, working design, how how does it work. Now, talking about the target group which is in a sense everybody, we have earlier it was mentioned about for example elderly people who have limited function with their fingers and hands, And I don't know how much we want to cater to children's use. So if you've designed something that's very attractive to children the mummy please mummy please you know we want it now we wanna go to the store and see it that has a lot of marketing pull. I think the children issue can be addressed with the shape and with colours. The question is only whether our budget will allow to have more than one design in a sense. but the target group as a whole is is basically everybody with a T_V_. can we is it even feasible to make one one remote control with something for everyone, or would we have to use the same electronics and make three different shapes? They have like removable plastic cases, so you can have a striped one or you can have a fluorescent blue one, or whatever, that in each package you know you have you you have you have for example you have let's say a fluorescent blue on it but then you have another colour or stripe whatever that already comes in a package. Well we may have to come back to one or two of these points at our next meeting but If we do some more research, maybe we.
As User Interface Designer I did a little research to find out what are the features which a user would like to have on their remote. something like a radio wave or a infrared light or a LED which can be used to change the different functionalities in the television Now there should be some timer to set for viewing a particular a particular programme or switching on and off a a particular programme according to the user choice. and then there should be a child lock system if a particular channel is not to be viewed by a particular for a certain age, then the parents can lock that particular channel so that the ch children cannot view that channel. one of the feature a user would like to have is the compactness of the co remote. and it should ha it should have as many buttons as possible for controlling different functionalities of the T_V_ television. And it should have an it can have an alarm clock and then to save electricity there should not be much s move lots of circuits and all that. And as this is my personal preference that it should be in the shape of a T_ in alphabet for more compactability. and I dunno what you feel about whether we can just say we have one target group and for this one target group we're gonna design this one thing
I take it you all have received instructions as to what you were supposed to do I think the Marketing Manager probably should go first, addressing the needs and desires. I thought that the method I should follow would be gather suggestions from everybody, and then as we go on what we'll have to do is accept and eliminate these suggestions according to design and budget feasibility. So I'll be coming to you frequently as the Industrial Expert to tell me how hard it's gonna be to add a feature or how expensive it's gonna be or if your time, if it takes five years to develop this it's just something we can't do. because if we're gonna sell this thing, I think the best time to sell it is as a Christmas present. So it's gotta be really attractive and then I'll be coming to you as the User Interface person to try to tell me from your point of view what are the most friendly features that we could put on it what what's what's gonna really be what they call a sizzle, A lot of times the thing that works the best from an engineering point of view isn't the thing that somebody's really just gonna take out their wallet and buy for Christmas for for their child or for their husband or whatever. Alright I I already did a little bit of research after our first meeting where we threw out some ideas and it looks to me that within the budget that we're looking at the the whole house idea really isn't gonna be possible. And then I found on the internet from from my research that some extended electronic entertainment control should be possible. At the budget that we're looking at and at the price point we're looking at, we should be able to make it work the T_V_, the V_C_R_, the stereo set maybe something else cute like a coffee pot or one other appliance or maybe a lamp.
Yeah, but but I what I'm very very much doubtful how how far it will work, because a speech recogniser like i it it has its own problems, issues. So to get a good recogni recognising system, it's a costly thing, I think.
Okay, so why don't we put down speech recognition if possible pending some more research from our industrial engineer on how expensive that is.
first we going over the minutes of the last meeting, more or less. in the last meeting the marketing manager had presented her method of working, Our technical manager has then said that she feels it should have a chip are we all in agreement that that's about what we discussed last time?
Now as an interface designer, I would give more emphasis on the interface, how the remote looks like Okay. Now the function of a remote is to send messages to the television. Then it should have a next button, Then, there should be a button which can give subtitles for a particular program which is going on a television. Then there should d there should be some buttons which can control features like the colour, colour of the picture, the contrast, sharpness, brightness of the picture. Now there should be a memory switch. Now the most important feature I would like to have in my remote would be the speech recognition feature. for example, if you want to see we if you want to see the ninth channel if you say just say ninth channel, th now the the yeah, the remote will automatically it will switch to the ninth channel. So this is one one of the interface which can be created. A very simple interface which has all the t important features. Then, these are some of the remotes which are different in shape and colour, but they have many buttons. So you can you can design an interface which is very simple, and which is user-friendly. Yeah, so this is one of the interface or one of the remote which has this vi voice recogniser. Yeah, now this is an interface for a chil for a remote which a child can use. And this comes with different colours, different shapes. Now this is a big over-sized remote which cannot be misplaced or it's impossible to misplace. And the personal preference would be a spe to incorporate speech recognisers which will respond to user's voice for a particular function.
any comments on her presentation? Well, looks like we still have quite a choice of things out there. But we're gonna have to narrow it down a little more. No, I think her presentation was good, and she really explored all the options. Yeah. this time I'm I'm going to concentrate more on the components and the technical side of the remote controller design.
I have just brief down few components which we require for the remote control construction. like if we want to have different colours, blue, red, green, so we have to use some colouring compone compone components. And the second important thing is integrated circuit. which we can use a highly sophisticated one because it's like the it's like the heart of the remote controller. And the other component we should we have in the remote controller is a resistor if we will be able to make a res rechargeable battery then we sh we need not go for a high performance battery, this is a normal remote controller. like you can see a chip there which is having eighteen pins, you can see the T_A_ double one eight three five labelled chip. you can also see the the green two green things are these are they are they are resistors, Actually, building a circuit bo board is pretty pretty easy and also it's a it's a l l inexpensive. b but a b a push-button requires a simple chip underneath it, but whereas a scroll wheel requires normally a regular chip which is a higher price range. or we can use solar sells. and a as energy source we offer a basic battery, a more ingenious hard dynamo, a kinetic provision of energy, Like we can have a ma material such as plastic, rubber, wood, titanium, yeah, on the scroll and the push-button, ca you can achieve scrolling by repeatedly pushing a button? No, no, no, th the the the scrolling wheels are different,
So it should be strong. if we will be able to make a res rechargeable battery then we sh we need not go for a high performance battery, b but a b a push-button requires a simple chip underneath it, but whereas a scroll wheel requires normally a regular chip which is a higher price range. Like for s scrolls we have to go for a sophisticated and and k full a complete chip. like you can go for a sw switches like buttons or scrolls, which which we used to do before ten ten years before, I think. Now, nobody uses that because you need you need a a k sophisticated chip and all. So I think it's better we go for ordinary buttons.
alright, my method is I'm interested in what the competition is doing, and wanna see how we can make ourselves different from the competition, and my findings from this is that, you know, small is beautiful. Simple is beautiful. And eye-catching is important.
And in my research this year I found out that fruit and vegetable shapes are really popular. They are more back into soft feel, spongy feeling things, things with maybe a little cloth on them.
And what we really have to decide in this meeting is the concept of the remote. I would like to include this feature which is called as voice recogniser. This could be one feature which could be sellable. Yeah, but but I what I'm very very much doubtful how how far it will work, because a speech recogniser like i it it has its own problems, issues. So to get a good recogni recognising system, it's a costly thing, I think. it it's like your recording of all a question already, and then you're expecting an answer from th Okay, so why don't we put down speech recognition if possible pending some more research from our industrial engineer on how expensive that is.
What kind of energy do we foresee? I think I think battery, and I think we all agreed on that. That that's that's gonna be most cost-effective and the best thing. Bright, colourful, trendy trendy design, and strong. Trendy design, compact and strong. Not sure what they mean by supplements. Her speech recognition feature would be a supplement.
You will receive specific instructions will be sent to you by your coaches.
Bright, colourful, trendy trendy design, and strong. Trendy design, compact and strong.
I think I think battery, and I think we all agreed on that. That that's that's gonna be most cost-effective and the best thing.
and the marketing expert with the product evaluation. and the U_I_D_ is supposed to come up with the user interface design, In this phase, the two of you, Jana and Francine, have to work together on a prototype using modelling clay, it says here. You will receive specific instructions will be sent to you by your coaches.
and the marketing expert with the product evaluation.
In this phase, the two of you, Jana and Francine, have to work together on a prototype using modelling clay, it says here.
and the U_I_D_ is supposed to come up with the user interface design,
Eight, eight point two. looks like we are well within budget. I just realised one thing. In the financing there was no room for our voice recogniser. I mean maximum we have another four point three euros I mean four thirty.
So we're just gonna have to settle for whatever quality that will buy us.
And then for the for the led, for the light emitting diode it is a fluorescent green
I just realised one thing. In the financing there was no room for our voice recogniser.
Okay now on the financing we bring up the kinetic source so that's in the energy source that's all we need. electronics, simple chip on print? I guess it's double curved. And then we have to interface push buttons. Eight, eight point two. looks like we are well within budget.
Eight, eight point two. In the financing there was no room for our voice recogniser.
Now we have included another feature that is the mute button Now we have included the switch on and off button. Then we have included one to nine buttons We have also included two buttons for increasing or decreasing the volume. Now our our model also contains a button which is called as the menu button. We have also included a button which is called as the swapping button.
and we're supposed to talk about those things as a team now, one being good and seven being the worst. Yes I think shape is one. And how about on size? I think I would give it at least a two. Colour, I gave it a one. One, one, one, okay. And how about the feel? I'll give three. maybe two, And the next is functionality I'll give it a three. It looks like we've got got ourselves a pretty good product.
Yes, it will have these buttons will have the numbers and all the rest of the buttons will have symbols.
I mean maximum we have another four point three euros I mean four thirty. So we're just gonna have to settle for whatever quality that will buy us.
like before we I have to redo the meetings from n th the minutes from the last meeting It should have nine channel buttons, a next button, volume buttons, subtitle buttons, switch to control features, colour contrast, sharpness etcetera. speech recognition is one of her very f favourite personal features she would like see d d to be integrated in this in this new remote. The industrial designer presented her thoughts on the issue. She would like a special case made out of plastic that is very strong, not using any harmful materials, should be recyclable and should be colourful. scrolling method is more expensive and not that practical anymore. The marketing expert who has to finally come up with to to to market this product has been watching the competition, has done some research on the internet and also has used h her personal observations to come up with the fact that such a remote sh should be small, easy to use and it should be eye catching. And the decision that we took last time was that the special feature we would like to see is a speech recogniser, should be trendy design, compact and strong,
and one more feature is we we have a holder for this remote which is an oyster shape. A shell shape.
the material is plastic and for the buttons it is s soft rubber
this is us in a snail shape so it it is attractive it's blue in colour bright and it has yellow buttons and all the different colour buttons
what I really like a lot about it is that you can reach the whole thing with one thumb, I like the idea that the on-off button is in a really prominent place. The colour's very attractive. Yes, it will have these buttons will have the numbers and all the rest of the buttons will have symbols. and one more feature is we we have a holder for this remote which is an oyster shape. A shell shape. I think voice recognition is our big selling point I think we have to, we have to dwell on on on the appearance.
This is a model of the remote control which we are going to build. this is us in a snail shape so it it is attractive bright and it has yellow buttons and all the different colour buttons it's blue in colour and also compact in shape. the material is plastic and for the buttons it is s soft rubber Now we have included another feature that is the mute button Now we have included the switch on and off button. Then we have included one to nine buttons We have also included two buttons for increasing or decreasing the volume. Now our our model also contains a button which is called as the menu button. We have also included a button which is called as the swapping button. And then for the for the led, for the light emitting diode it is a fluorescent green And at the end, it this remote has inbuilt voice recogniser which c which will recognise the user's voice and then it'll act accordingly.
and also compact in shape.
personally I think I'm pretty happy. and then the next question is are we happy with the leadership of this project? I think you've done a good job, Miss leader. Yeah I d I do too I think we worked well together as a team, yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah maybe we could've used the whiteboard a little bit more, yeah, I think we we did, in more than one respect and so I think we did very well here. So I I thank you all very much.
Here is what we looking at satisfaction on for example room for creativity. Is there more room for creativity or are we absolutely happy? We can always improve, yes. so I think I I mean we can just have small buttons and more buttons in that case. If we want to have more features than that. Well then again if we're gonna do the speech recognition thing we're gon there gonna be some buttons that are gonna have to be added for that for the recording of the the speech. maybe we can eliminate one of the mute buttons, instead of having two mute buttons., are we happy with the creativity that has passed here
I mean maximum we have another four point three euros I mean four thirty. So we're just gonna have to settle for whatever quality that will buy us.
we can do it international,
as you can see, we for our remote control, a selling price is twenty five Euros. Our selling price.
Our production cost can be maximal twelve and a half Euros,
As you can see we've got the smart boards here and here in the white board. in the white board here there's a little tool bar on this side. Here are some functions. You can save. these functions we don't have anything to do with, only undo, you can undo a little piece of drawing. A blank new document for each person. select a pen, eraser. then we've got our pen. This pen. It's really funny You can also select the current colour and the line width. and it's easy to draw your findings and drawings on there. We've got our shared folder, But all you will found that already because there are a lot of documents in it already, so if you have a document you wanna show, just open it from the folder. Here is a simple tool bar. it's save, print, move back or forward one page. You can switch between the different drawings. And then we're going to try out the white board. We're going to draw animal. And just sum up a few of its favourite characteristics. the only thing we have to look after is that we use different colours, and different line width. You can use this pen by holding it like a like a little child. Because if you hold it like this, the sensors will get blocked Another thing is you have to be a bit slow. 'Cause if you're going to draw like really fast then the pen won't hold up. we choose form of current colour I think grey is appropriate. Now you'll see my drawing capabilities. you have to do it real slow. I was trying to draw a dolphin, And then you can undo Maybe you have to hold it a bit upside-down. now I'm gonna hand over the pen on the new blank sheet to you. Gonna use a different line width. Maybe it's easier to draw the smaller line width, I think. You have to go really slow when you're writing. I'm just gonna draw its head, I was gonna draw a cat too, it's pretty
This is our agenda. we have our opening acquaintance, tool training, project plan description closing. then I can take some notes Maybe you can take the minutes once in a while. but just if you hear something you can write down, just write it down. our project aim is as you can see a new remote control. It has to be original, trendy, and user friendly. project method is there are three phases we are going through. First is functional des design, individual work, meetings. After the functional design, then the conceptual design and the detailed design. The Industrial Designer is going to work on the working design, components design and a bit of the look and feel design. the User Interface Designer is going to do the technical function design, user interface concept and user interface design. And the marketing expert is doing a little bit of user requirement specification, trend watching and project product ev evaluation. But that will be all worked out in other meetings.
And we can all work on our own projects.
move along to the project finance. as you can see, we for our remote control, a selling price is twenty five Euros. Our selling price. our profit aim is fifty million Euros. we can do it international, so we have to focus on different kind of users, different kind of cultures, and different kind of trends as well. Our production cost can be maximal twelve and a half Euros, just try to remember these points. Selling price twenty five, profit aims fifty million, but more important is the int international market we're trying to focus on. And production cost maximal twelve and a half Euros. that's leads us to our little discussion. does everybody has experiences with remote controls, and I mean not the ordinary mote controls, but also a little bit different ones? Like you can use for other? No, me neither. kind of broad T_V_ at home, and a D_V_D_ player, so we got like a lot of remote controls, one for the T_V_, one for the video recorder, one for the D_V_D_ player. And I think it's it would be best to just make one remote control that can operate them all. I've I've got one at home. And you can program I think eight different devices in it, I think that if you can put different kind of devices in one remote control, it makes it a lot easier as well. we've we want different functions and we can maybe see if we can do something with the infra-red. And it also operates on infra-red, and then you can operate it from the third or th or second floor. so you have to got the little device inside your room, Think it has to be shock proof Sure, yeah. my remote control tends to fall a lot. Waterproof, Thought it might be handy to put a battery status display on it. how much is left in the battery. But maybe just a little LED,
Waterproof,
But they'll also really drag up the production costs, so think we'll have to see about that too.
I don't know if you've noticed, but we're working for Real Reaction. We put fashion in electronics, we put a lot of effort in design and in the product itself. have you all seen the corporate website already? Have you seen any flaws in it? I think I found one. But on the corporate information side there's a th there was Real Remote instead of Real Reaction.
First I will introduce myself. I'm Bart, My name's Frank. let's start off with a little presentation. Now first I'll tell you a little bit about the setting. You can see there are a few cameras here. They'll record our actions and you'll have wires and microphones that will record your voice. is there a project documents folder? There are some notes in it already I see, some documents.
I think that if you can put different kind of devices in one remote control, it makes it a lot easier as well.
Think it has to be shock proof
User Interface Designer the user interface concept, and the trend-watching.
what we're going to do for the next meeting is the Industrial Designer will do the components concept,
I suggest let's have a discussion on the control functions. we can see if we can find a way between the functions we wanna use and the market we wanna reach with our product. 'cause you're you're saying that teletext is gonna be an old feature But I think if you're targeting people of forty plus, the chance that they will have a T_V_ with internet access within the next like twenty years is very slim. In addition people indicated that teletext simply was an important feature for the remote control. So I think it's pretty dumb to put no teletext feature on it. Besides that, I think the market for forty plus is like pretty small. But I mean if I s if I see this, it's I think we're just gonna go for another Standard remote. I think we can do a lot with the design and the simple buttons if we put a lot of effort in those, we can make a remote control with just two or three buttons. Or just a remote which is suitable for the market we wanna reach if you look in Holland at the whole generation of forty plus, fifty plus, it it's the the biggest share of the of the whole population now. But don't you think that if we make a remote which is typically made for this market, that people think the people think that's the the device I've looked for although I didn't realise it. I think that if we're If we put our marketing right we can sell this just like I don't know if you've heard about it in the news, the the elderly mobile phone? if we if we make a remote control just l with that idea in mind, we could make tons of money, I think. We don't have to focus on on on the on the design then but on functionality. I think teletext can be can be a function as well. But only if if it won't higher the the cost, But deaf people need teletext for for subtitles. I think
I've got a presentation about the working design. first about how it works. Everybody knows how a remote works. The user presses a button. The remote determines what button it is, uses the infrared to send a signal to the T_V_. The T_V_ switches to the frequency, or what function it is. we've got the the plate. It gots conductive disks for every button. When the user presses a button, a signal got sent, goes to the LED and transmits tranmi transmits its to the T_V_. this is a schematic overview. You've got the buttons. The power source. And when a button gets pressed, its goes to the chip. I think we should use default materials, simple plastics. Keep the inner workings simple, I think we should focus on aesthetics, the design and the user interface, and if you use high-tech materials it come back in every product. it's, in my idea, it's it's gonna be smart to invest in di in design and not in in the product itself. so I'm here to mess things up and tell you some new requirements. we've got to design a remote which is only suitable for T_V_. that's because it will be too complex and the time to market will be too big, if we wanna have it for more functions. another point is we have to skip the teletext, because in the world of upcoming internet we think teletext is going to be a thing of the past. Another one is the customer is forty plus. that's the the market we have to to to target, because we are going to develop a new product which is specially designed for the younger customers. And we have to be very attent in putting the corporate image in our product. So it has to be visible in our design, in the way our device works.
Because I think what we're going to design now is for people above sixty, maybe. Now you're talking about sixty to eighty for example.
we've got to design a remote which is only suitable for T_V_.
I think if we are gonna use a touchscreen we're gonna go way above the twelve and a half Euros. N I I don't think so. you got quite a cheap touchscreen. S it's not in colour or something. I don't know if that will rise the cost too much, I think we'll have to choose between the docking station or the screen,
I've been looking at the user interface of it. f for the techno f functions of of it. I think we must use the general functions of the remote control. I I've been thinking about a simple manner to put a lot of functions in one in one remote control. I've do I've done a little research on the internet and not much information about it, about interface so you've got a lot of devi devices like D_V_D_ television, stereo. But it must be user-friendly. you c you can't put a a lot of functions in one Yeah. Yeah. In one remote control. you can see, this is quite simple remote control. but This re remote control got a a lot of buttons. what I was thinking about was keep the general functions like they are. like the on-off button. keep it yeah l like a red button. My personal preferences. Use a display for specific functions of the different device. And here you've got a s kind of a display. It's a touchscreen. you got a general f f the functions of the device for a D_V_D_ player or so the pl yeah f for playing reverse. And you got here real buttons for selecting a device. you you never got all the buttons on w one device. We better c use quite large buttons Everybody have to use it so ol even even old people young people. we must keep buttons quite s simple and quite large. I think if we are gonna use a touchscreen we're gonna go way above the twelve and a half Euros. N I I don't think so. you got quite a cheap touchscreen. S it's not in colour or something. it would certainly make a fancy design. But the It wouldn't be very robust.
In different languages, you know. adapt it to different cultures. And with the little screen in it, which explains the buttons. You could I think we n it would be a lot easier to
But it might be a good idea to make a docking station. And this would, could get a button in it which would send a signal to the remote which would then beep. So you'd know where it is in the room. And in addition to this it could recharge the batteries in the remote if you put it in. Then a surprisingly great deal of people w indicated that an L_C_D_ screen in the remote control would be preferred. This was mostly people in the age of sixteen to twenty five. This would also greatly increase the production costs but I think these are just some small factors we could consider.
it might be a good idea to have just a little screen on it,
now we're going into the functional design. Then our agenda. first the opening. this time I will take the minutes. you're going to have a presentation. All of you. and we've got forty minutes for the whole prese for the whole presentations. So I suggest we take about seven minutes per presentation, and then we can have a little discussion about the new project requirements And then the decision on the control functions which we wanna include and those which we don't wanna include. My name is Freek Van Ponnen. I'm the Market Expert. We have we have been doing research in a usability lab where we observed users operating remote controls. we let them fill out a questionnaire. in addition we did some market research. see what the market consists of. What ages are involved. these are three quite astonishing results, I thought. seventy five percent of the people questioned indicated that they thought their remote were was ugly. and an additional eighty percent indicated that they would spend more money on a fancy-looking remote control. in addition remotes were not very functional. Fifty percent of the people indicated they only loo used about ten percent of the buttons on a remote control. And fifty percent of the people indicated that their remote tended to get lost in their room. Then we did some research to the most relevant functions. Channel selection and volume selection both got a ten on a scale of one to ten for relevancy. The power button got a nine. And teletext got a six and a half. Then there are some one-time use function. That audio settings, video settings, and channel settings buttons. Which are not really used very frequently, but are still considered to be of some importance. channel selection was also indicated to be used very frequently. One hundred and sixty eight times per hour. sixty percent of the market consists of users between the ages sixteen and forty f six. the users of forty six to sixty five years cons The make up forty percent of the market. They are not really
If we're able to really bring an innovative product. which would explain a button if you press it.
it might be a good idea to have just a little screen on it, Few buttons, we talked about that. Docking station, L_C_D_. general functions
if we if we make a remote control just l with that idea in mind, we could make tons of money, I think. Because I think what we're going to design now is for people above sixty, maybe. If we want a with for example the the telephone for elderly people, we can target the real elderly people. Now you're talking about sixty to eighty for example. But I'd have to look into that a little more.
I think it's very important in the in the design. You can make a very fancy design with putting the buttons on the right places. But I don't think I think if you're gonna make a remote control only to operate a T_V_, you there's not much you can gain on having as few buttons as possible. you suggest we could better focus on for example the docking station. I think, mean we obviously need a good way to position all the buttons But I don't think we should spend very much time in that. Do you think the docking station will is allowed in the budget we have? And if the remote stays rather small, it should be possible we're just gonna focus on the extras? I think so.
Few buttons, we talked about that. Docking station, L_C_D_. general functions
maybe we can implement the scroll button? Just look if you look at telephones. The Sony telephone has a scroll button which is very useful in searching names or but I don't think there are many T_V_s that can switch channels that fast. And so you would need like the T_V_ would need an a function where you can actually view all channels and scroll through it. If we're gonna focus on elderly people they'll have to adapt. So perhaps we should s stick to the basic layout.
Few buttons, we talked about that. Docking station, L_C_D_. general functions
I think teletext can be can be a function as well. But only if if it won't higher the the cost,
But do you need the buttons for one to zero. Think if you're gonna include teletext you do. maybe we can implement the scroll button? Or a joystick like? But I don't think I think if you're gonna make a remote control only to operate a T_V_, you there's not much you can gain on having as few buttons as possible.
Besides that, I think the market for forty plus is like pretty small. But I mean if I s if I see this, it's I think we're just gonna go for another Standard remote. if you look in Holland at the whole generation of forty plus, fifty plus, it it's the the biggest share of the of the whole population now.
But I think if you're targeting people of forty plus, the chance that they will have a T_V_ with internet access 'cause you're you're saying that teletext is gonna be an old feature within the next like twenty years is very slim. In addition people indicated that teletext simply was an important feature for the remote control. So I think it's pretty dumb to put no teletext feature on it. I think teletext can be can be a function as well. But only if if it won't higher the the cost, But deaf people need teletext for for subtitles. I think it'd definitely be a bad idea not to include teletext. I think that's a good idea as well, especially for the subtitles. Is anybody really against teletext?
So check out the corporate website maybe. It's important that the corporate design image is going to be in the remote.
that brings us to the discussion about our concepts. first I think we can talk about the energy source, f I think first of all we have to see it is possible to introduce kinetic energy in our budget, I think. We could use the basic normal battery. a hand dynamo. there there are four options. But I don't think that's really an option. solar cells. But not every room is very light Or the kinetic energy. And how exactly does the kinetic energy work? y you basically shake your remote, and then it powers up. personally I don't think that older people like to shake their remote control before they use it. And besides that you mentioned it would make the docking station obsolete. And I think our docking station could be one of the marketing issues with which we can get great popularity for our product. you could insert the find the lost remote control function in there. it's just a small display so I believe it will run on one battery for six months or f or or more. I think elderly people just like to have everything in place. And I don't think they they like remotes just laying everywhere in their rooms. So maybe a docking station will help them give the remote a place. And also what you said. you can introduce voice recognition by finding back your remote. But I think it's more efficient and cheaper to put it in the docking station. So you have a but button on your docking station which you can push, and then it starts beeping. And then we can we can still use the voice recognition, but maybe then for only the the channels. I'm wondering what will the voice recognition mean for the production price? I don't have any information on pricing. we also asked if w they would, if people would pay more for speech recognition in a remote control. you can see here, our target group would not do that. So if that would increase the price for which we're selling our remote control
So the Industrial Designer and User Interface Designer are going to work together on this one.
The user interface design, it's the same story. And product evaluation.
let me just choose for the battery. but I think just a simple battery which you can reload on a docking station is just as good.
But that would also go for the L_C_D_ screen then I guess. It's a bit higher percentage, here the question was, would you prefer it. And on top of that the L_C_D_ screen would help in making the remote control easier to use. And I think a voice recognition function would not make the remote control much easier to use. I personally think the L_C_D_ screen we wanna use, with the extra information, I think nobody has anything against it. Because it's just some extra information, Maybe we have to discard the voice recognition.
Because it's just some extra information, I personally think the L_C_D_ screen we wanna use, with the extra information, I think nobody has anything against it.
f I think first of all we have to see it is possible to introduce kinetic energy in our budget, I think. personally I don't think that older people like to shake their remote control before they use it. And besides that you mentioned it would make the docking station obsolete. And I think our docking station could be one of the marketing issues with which we can get great popularity for our product. you could insert the find the lost remote control function in there. it's just a small display so I believe it will run on one battery for six months or f or or more. I think elderly people just like to have everything in place. And I don't think they they like remotes just laying everywhere in their rooms. So maybe a docking station will help them give the remote a place. in that case we could use kinetic energy, but I think just a simple battery which you can reload on a docking station is just as good. And much cheaper as well. And that's the best choice. let me just choose for the battery.
I suggest the single curved,
I'm gonna inform you about the trend-watching I've done over the past few days. we've done some market research. We distributed some more enquetes, questionnaires. And besides that I deployed some trend-watchers to Milan and Paris to well get all of the newest trends. most important thing is the fancy design. the research indicated that that was by far the most important factor. innovativeness was about half as important as the fancy design. By innovativeness this means functions which are not featured in other remote controls. about half of, half as important as the innovativeness was the was easy to use. for our group, we're focusing on the people of sixty to eighty y years old, this is, these factors are slightly more equal. the older people prefer dark colours. they like recognisable shapes, and familiar material. And our surveys have indicated that especially wood is pretty much the material for older people. this leads us to some personal preferences. the remote control and the docking station should blend in in the in the room. so this would mean no eye-catching designs. Just keep it simple the docking station and small screen would be our main points of interest, because this would be the These would be the innovativeness in the remote control. well the trend-watchers I consulted advised that it b should be, the remote control and the docking station should be telephone-shaped. So you could imagine that the remote control will be standing up straight in the docking station. This is pretty much a new shape to older people. So they would prefer a design where the remote control just lies flat in the docking station. besides that we would advise to bring two editions, one with a wood-like colour and maybe feel, and one with a grey-black colour. The wood-like for the more exclusive people. People with more money.
It's the conceptual design meeting. And a few points of interest in this meeting are the conceptual specification of components. conceptual specification of design. And also trend-watching. but first I'll show you the agenda. first the opening. Then we have three presentations. after that we have to come to a decision on remote control concepts. Then a little thing about the last meeting. these are the points we agreed on. The requirements and the target market. requirements are teletext, docking station, audio signal, small screen, with some extras that button information. And we are going to use default materials. And we're going to target sixty to to eighty year old customers. I suggest let's get started with the presentations.
About the components design. for the energy source we can use a basic battery or, a as an optional thing, a kinetic energy, like in a watch, But if we choose for that option, the docking station would c become obsolete. So I don't think it's really an option. for the casing, the manufacturing department can deliver a flat casing, single or double curved casing. It's really up the the design that we're gonna use. as a case supplement, we could, I thought of that l later, a rubber belt, like a anti-slip. for the b buttons, we can use plastic or rubber. And the chip-set, it says simple here, but it should be advanced, because we're using an L_C_D_ screen. And as the trend-watcher presentation showed, people like wood, but it raises the price and it doesn't really fit the image, unless we would start two product lines. well the kinetic energy source is rather fancy. But depends on what we want. for the case, the supplement and the buttons, it really depends on the designer.
some research a about designing of an interface. the last meeting we had a about using a f few buttons. that's w what I what I want to to do in our design. just we have just to focus on the primary functions. finding an attractive way to control the remote control. the I found some something about speech recognition. only buttons for sound, for on-off, shifting u up sa ca channel or down shifting down. we need some new a attractive functions it's like a speak speech recognition and a special button for selecting subtitles. overall user-friendly. using large large buttons. It's possible to to make quite cheap system for speech recognition. you can think about when you lost your remote control, you can call it and it gives an sig signal. And and for shifting up a sen c ch channel or for putting out sound or something, you can just give a sign say sound off Television put the sound off put the sound off. I was thinking about the special button for subtitles, just one button to keep it simple. one push on the button you get small subtitles. double push push, if double click, so you get big subtitles, for people which c f who can't read small subtitles. we've got the buttons we have to use. The on-off, sound on-off, sound higher or lower, the numbers, zero to nine. the general buttons m more general b one button for shifting up and shifting down channel. also we want to use a little d display for for displaying the the functions of the buttons. And we can build in a function f which shows the channel or some which the t television is on. made a little picture of it. Just we can put the on-off button over in this corner, D display of it, it's just a small display. you can put it on top. and a special button for shifting up and shifting down channel, it's on place where the thumb of of the
wood is a lot more expensive to produce. if we wanna choose for wood or the black and grey. Or both? but I think it will attract elderly people who wanna have something exclusive, And I think most important factor there is the wooden colour. But with colour was a lot more expensive? Or? I'll have to research. It's a lot more difficult to to handle and to to get in the right shape.
is it possible to make changeable case. I think that's a very good option. everybody's okay with the changing covers? I think that's a good good option.
So it's gotta be advanced. That brings us to the chip.
but I think just a simple battery which you can reload on a docking station is just as good. let me just choose for the battery.
if we're n gonna make a scroll-button anyway it'd be more for the younger people than for the older people. So maybe we should just re-focus. Just put it on the market for everybody.
I think we can discard the help and the mute button by pressing down volume long, or pressing down a a number long. I was thinking, maybe you could just integrate three of those numbers to one button. Or we can leave out the ten buttons and take one scroll wheel for the programme numbers.
that brings us to the project evaluation. Did we move through the right phases, you think? Along the process? Think we should have a should have had the finance thingy a lot earlier. In the design phase. So lack of information about prices. The tasks are very structured,
if we're n gonna make a scroll-button anyway it'd be more for the younger people than for the older people. So maybe we should just re-focus. Just put it on the market for everybody.
maybe it's feasible to just put the price of the remote up a little. but we have to stick to the twelve and a half Euros. I'd rather just go to the board and get us to spend eighteen dollars a a remote.
Is the company company recognisable? Yes it is. And they wanna put fashion in their products. in the slogan of the company. And we have the removable front cases.
Was there room for creativity? Not too much. No. It's because of the finance sheet. Yeah. Yeah, there w there was enough room, but the finance And I would've liked to go for the younger users also. And just to be able to access internet and get something of your own. Was it clear what everybody had to do according to their roles and functions? Yeah? Teamwork? Did it work out? Working together? Also, you two of you with the last phase?
Only the docking station, I guess. Which isn't the the docking station isn't even in this c s schematic. it's not even taken into the price.
I did some literature study study, and analysis of the requirements we set up earlier. Translated it into criteria,, is the remote fancy? The shape, look and feel. Innovative? What new functions are there?, easy to use?, learnability is a very important factor here., is it functional? And the cost. The target group. Is the remote really for the group we're making it for? I have to say this was a little hard, because the minutes of our last meeting were not here. that's because my pen failed to upload his data. Is the design fancy, on a scale of one to seven? We all go for six?, is the design innovative? I think so, Seven? Is the design easy to use?. Not really. I would say four. Four or five between. Between four or five. Is it functional? Yes. Do we have too many functions? No. Think it's seven. and do we take care of the biggest frustrations of the remote control? Like it getting lost and R_S_I_ influences?, we haven't thought of that one. Think we do. Are the production costs within the preset limits? they are now. Does the design fit the group of focus? I think that's a three. I think with our new radio button, I think it's I think it's better. I still I think it's too m too fancy. Too too flashy. I would give it a four. I think I'd go for two. we have the logo there. These are seven factors times seven is forty something. Two? Forty one out of forty nine. That's Around eighty percent. I think that's a pretty nice score.
I think we still have to fit in one more questionnaire. I think. I think I'm going to make our final presentation now. And then I will be back in about ten minutes to show you the final presentation. Summary of the project. Are we supposed to go into our own rooms again? maybe we have to fill another questionnaire.
I will move on to the finance part, And I can tell you that we're going to have a pretty hard time producing this for twelve and a half Euros. I don't know if I've filled in correctly, so just correct me if you see something wrong. I counted two batteries. But maybe we can also use one. Since it rechargeable. That's two Euros off. We need the advanced chip. Here we have the single curves. we can see that the difference between uncurved and the single curved is one Euro., but I think the single curved is good for design, and also for the display to have a prominent place on the remote control. Then we have the case material supplements. It's plastic. It's the cheapest one we need. But then the biggest costs are the buttons. So maybe we really should try to discard some buttons to keep our costs low. Let's fir first count the buttons we have now. seventeen. with the help button. I think we can discard the help and the mute button by pressing down volume long, or pressing down a a number long.
But then again that would be d j just pretty much not an option for older people, who don't even know what a scroll-wheel is. With only five buttons on it. And a scroll-wheel. Holding a remote with which they expect to have like ten buttons for the numbers one to zero. I think if you make a good advertisement on television and in the in the guide, you can explain to the people how to use the scroll wheel. This will really require a lot of marketing to get this to sell. 'Cause if older people like familiar forms and familiar stuff. This is not familiar for them. But they know the scroll-buttons from old radios. they cal also buttons like that for changing channels.
this is what me and Richard came up with. The default spot for the on-off button. The mute button just below that. Then there's the volume and channel selectors. Simple plus-minus button. we thought of a help button. If you hold it and you press another button, the help goes to the L_C_D_ screen. Then there's the zero to one to zero buttons. A button for teletext. A button for the subtitles. And the company logo. So it's rather simple prototype., is this the moment where we ask or can ask questions about the functionality?, when you're in teletext there usually are buttons where you just you just press it and you g go to the next teletext page., that's just the normal as th as the normal remote controls you came in page one hundred. Now you can use the normal one to zero buttons. But you can also use the button th for changing the the channel. S so the shifting button. for yeah shif shifting up in on t on t teletext, and shifting down. So I thought in a few meetings earlier we tried to keep it simple. just a few buttons and large buttons. But I think these are altogether quite a quite a few buttons. So I'm wondering if we if we neely really need all of those buttons. I think if you look at most controls, they've got more buttons than this. the on-off button, it's it's a necessity. The volume and channel buttons, you need you obviously need those those. The mute button could be replaced by pressing the volume-down button twice. I think the help button really is necessary because there's no other way to know when someone wants to know what a button does., or you can build in when you press one button you can't leave out the number buttons I guess. teletext and subtitles are yeah necessary. So it's rather basic already. Just n normal plain buttons. But they're supposed to be equal sized, round, with a with a little logo on it for the for the volume, the
I still think we should go for the single curve design.
But then again that would be d j just pretty much not an option for older people, who don't even know what a scroll-wheel is. I think if you make a good advertisement on television and in the in the guide, you can explain to the people how to use the scroll wheel. But they know the scroll-buttons from old radios. they cal also buttons like that for changing channels. 'Cause if older people like familiar forms and familiar stuff. This is not familiar for them.
I think we can discard the help and the mute button by pressing down volume long, or pressing down a a number long., d I assume you'd count the volume and channel thingies for two buttons each, can't we integrate the teletext and the subtitles in one button? I think so. Yeah. With only five buttons on it. And a scroll-wheel. Holding a remote with which they expect to have like ten buttons for the numbers one to zero. And just If you press the volume button you can control the volume with the scroll-wheel. So we make one for the volume, one for the channel. Plus scroll. we can leave the teletext in if we want. So we can decrease this one to four buttons.
Or we can leave out the ten buttons and take one scroll wheel for the programme numbers. If you scroll you will see the numbers on the L_C_D_ display. Until you've got the right number, then you push it. That would bring up the price of the scroll-wheel also. Integrated scroll-wheel push-button. but then you you can push some other button as well. Yeah. That's right. So if you scroll to a number and then you wait a half second, then it g turns to that channel.
In this meeting we will discuss our final design. But first we will do the this is prototype presentation. this is what me and Richard came up with.
So we make one for the volume, one for the channel. Plus scroll. can't we integrate the teletext and the subtitles in one button?
If you scroll you will see the numbers on the L_C_D_ display. And we can keep our L_C_D_ screen, which can provide extra information. How to use the scroll wheel. How to use the other bu buttons as subtitles.
I personally think it has to be multi-purpose. next meeting will start in thirty minutes. you will have individual actions the the the Industrial Designer has to look at the working design. the User Interface Designer has to look at the technical functions.
now it's time for us to going to discuss a little things. You can think about experience with a remote control yourself, at home. What you think might be a useful new feature. What what can distinguish our new trendy remote control from all the others. I think the most important thing of a remote control is that you can switch channels. And my opinion is you should keep it as basic as possible. So not a not a remote control who which can can be used for television and a D_V_D_ and radio most of the remote c remote controls are just for one purpose. And by making it multi-purpose, it has a new feature, adds a new feature to the market, and distinguish from from current products. maybe some other technology than infrared. I rather find it very annoying, like when someone is standing in front of the T_V_ then you can't switch it. think about sending it over radio waves or bluetooth. That might be a little bit expensive. And something like an L_C_D_ screen. that, when you're on a certain channel, you can see on the L_C_D_ screen what programmes are coming up or it must be really innovative, technical-wise? you got some cheap remote controls there. you got a dozen of 'em. But when you enter a new market with a remote control and wanna gain market share you have to do something special, I think. at the beginning of such a project, it's it's it's very cool to talk about, well, this would be cool, that would be cool. but we must not lose sight of the the user friendly And and the price.
But our marketing range is, market range is international. So we have virtually the whole world we can sell we can sell our r remotes to.
the selling price for the remote will be twenty five Euro, and the production cost may not be more than twenty and a half Euro. from my point of view, I don't think it's gonna be very very high tech, high definition, ultra modern kinda remote, for twelve fift twelve and a half Euro. the profit we must make with the new remote is fifty million Euro. I think w when the selling price is twenty five, you got two million, two million remotes.
little little kinda exercise to know each other. At the white board on the left. Every every one of us must draw our favourite animal, and tell tell us why we had chosen that animal. important is that we use different colours, and different pen widths. Widths. Widths. and he's called Simba. Miniature size? So we found it kinda cool to name it after a lion. It is a turtle. 'Cause I liked Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles. It's a dog. we had a dog, a few years ago. when it died we didn't get a new one or something. It's the white rabbit from The Matrix. Yeah, exactly.
the tool training. and this is only for drawing. This one is for the presentations, the PowerPoint presentations or the Word presentation of whatever you you had. We have two smart boards. and as you may have heard, the documents in the shared folder can be showed on this screen. Not in y the the My Documents. This is very straightforward, with the save, the print, the undo, the blank, the select, the pen.
this is the agenda for today. first a little opening. I will introduce myself, and I think it's very good to introduce yourself. then a little bit of acquaintance, acquaintance to to to ourselves. that will be done with a tool training from the he these two smart boards. Then the project plan. and discussion about that and a little closing at the end. the the the aim is to make a new remote control. first of all it must be original, and trendy. But at the same time user-friendly. there are three stages. There is a functional design. Then the conceptual design.
my name is Danny Wolfs. I'm the Project Manager. I'm Juergen Toffs. I'm the User Interface Designer. my name's. I'm the Industrial Designer. my function is the Marketing Expert. I'm Tim.
we must first agree on what we're going to m going to make. I figure we could get back to it on the next meeting actually. That's a phase further. make some mock-ups, some some general ideas. But maybe, because you are working on the user requirements, you are working on the technical functions, we must have a little or kinda Consensus on the, what we're gonna do. So you don't come up with the user requirements who don't fit the the the the technical functions at all. I don't know. if the technical functions have to be designed, I I've gotta know for what kind of machines they will be. th that's that's really a step further. we all have a list of things that has to b that have to be in it, or how it has to be like. And then in the next meeting we decide And then you s then you can delete the o the obsolete details. each individually i individually must think on what's at his point of view is the most important. And then we're going to fit all the pieces together the next meeting.
I think the most important thing of a remote control is that you can switch channels. And my opinion is you should keep it as basic as possible. So not a not a remote control who which can can be used for television and a D_V_D_ and radio I personally think it has to be multi-purpose. most of the remote c remote controls are just for one purpose. And by making it multi-purpose, it has a new feature, adds a new feature to the market, and distinguish from from current products.
it must be really innovative, technical-wise? you have to do something special, I think. you got some cheap remote controls there. you got a dozen of 'em. But when you enter a new market with a remote control and wanna gain market share most of the remote c remote controls are just for one purpose. And by making it multi-purpose, it has a new feature, adds a new feature to the market, and distinguish from from current products.
the User Interface Designer has to look at the technical functions.
the the the Industrial Designer has to look at the working design.
we must first agree on what we're going to m going to make. I figure we could get back to it on the next meeting actually. That's a phase further. make some mock-ups, some some general ideas. But maybe, because you are working on the user requirements, you are working on the technical functions, we must have a little or kinda Consensus on the, what we're gonna do.

And then we're going to fit all the pieces together the next meeting.
but what I did think about was when you mentioned about the the cup-holder, is why not introduce a speech function like where is the remote. If somebody says, where is the remote, then it goes beep beep beep beep or something, maybe maybe something to look into, I dunno what the cost that something like that would be.
I'll I'll just explain a bit of the components. The energy source would be a battery, simple battery I figured that would be best, the energy source is connected to the infrared button, but the infrared button works only via the chip and the subcomponent to the switch when a button is prush pushed in, a electric current goes through here, and in immediately, a l a bulb lights up displaying to the user that something has happened. That's that's so the h user won't be thinking, well did the button be pressed, w what happened. the signal goes via chip that's translated into electric sig electronic signals and then it's processed and then it's sent to the infrared bulb my personal preferences here, we have to keep it simple. Not too many gadgets and functions, I I think we should stick by with infrared transmitting and no receiving. I think we shouldn't be spending time on teletext and st things like that, because when you want teletext on infrared you'd have to build in a receiver too, I think current T_V_s can even send infrared. but should we spend money or and time on building a receiver into the remote control? 'Cause that would be I mean extra components, extra designs, larger g remote control. So I I my personal opinion is no no no receiver at all. we should look into the design and the functionability. Like I said, use one button for instance for m multiple functions, just hide the few buttons o of switching it open or something, the usual stuff. we shouldn't make a big remote control for simple functions, but we we should stick to the basics.
I'm going to give a presentation abut some of the technical functions of these design and usability functions. what's my opinion about what's most important to combine the design, technical possibilities and the user friendliness in one, so if you going to design a remote that looks good, that shouldn't weigh over the if it's possible to make, of course, but also the user friendliness, And another one is the use of many functions will will make it more difficult, so use as as little functions as possible or at least don't display them all at once on the same remote. And well one of the ideas was maybe use touch screen, but s I don't know in how far that is possible, since we are sticking to infrared and and the remote cannot receive anything, but we might consider that. So just keep it simple, make clear buttons, easy to use. I prefer to use it only for T_V_ and and if possible, the buttons should give a dr direct action, not first select you you just said you wanted to to combine more functions in one, and so that's where the difficulties lie. Do we want to use a few options and might not be so or original, or multi-purpose as we thought, or do we want to use many buttons. it's maybe an option if you use an L_C_D_ or a touch screen, that in the middle are the the main keys, just in the middle the general functions, like play, channel switching, and then at the top or at the bottom, some menus like settings or that you can drop down. Do we want to use a menu display on the T_V_? Or does have to f everything be in remotes? 'Cause if you use a memory display on the T_V_, you can simply push a more menu and then select the options you want to have and press okay. if you use many options in one buttle button, display the menu on the T_V_ and don't use combination of t of two buttons at the same
it seems like the young users of remote controls really like the fancy new technology stuff, like an L_C_D_ screen on the remote control, speech recognition. I don't think that's really appropriate., and when you see the audience, the age is going up Yeah, they don't really want it anymore, at least the new technologies. Second findings out of the questionnaire are the opinion the opinions of the audience about current remote controls. First point is, seventy five percent of the users find the most repo remote controls very ugly, and eighty percent of the users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy. According to the frequency of use versus importance investigation, following buttons are most important. Switching channels, yeah, the second, teletext, and the third, volume controls. But it's strange that the the manage board the management board said that the teletext will be outdated by the internet. but at the moment teletext is Yeah, th the best thing you can get on T_V_, like getting information. they use teletext and not the internet on a remote control.
my personal preferences., I think we should aim at the audience from sixteen to forty five., first of all it's the biggest share, the biggest audience, sixty five percent. second, I think you will get the most revenue from i from it. we have to impro improve the most used functions, as I said here, switching channels, teletext and volume controls. people used to get lost off the remote controller, so maybe it's an idea for us to design ex kind of placeholder on side of the, yeah, of the T_V_ that's a cool idea. When you mentioned improving functions, what what do you mean by that but it came out that a lot of buttons weren't even used on a remote control. So you can have a remote control full of buttons, a hundreds hundreds of buttons, but if you don't use them, yeah it's so focusing more on the used buttons. but the most used buttons have to be bigger or Could you use perhaps one button for multiple functions, like example pressing it in longer makes it switch to an different function for example. Yeah, perhaps.
I'll be explaining a bit about working design about the project. what I did was I dissected current remote controls and I viewed how how they w looked, what kind of components are involved, And after that I put up a scheme about how these things are organised and I'll show it to you in in a in a few seconds. And I'll explain a bit about how it works
what I did was I I checked remote controls and the remote controls of today are all infrared, And the thing about that is the remote controls have to act as a T_V_ or a stereo or something, and those have a transmitter that's also focused on infrared, so if we want to build a remote control with Bluetooth for instance then the T_V_ should have Bluetooth too in order to communicate, so that would mean extra cost for the user So that's probably why most controls are still infrared. Furthermore they all have a a very simple structure, 'cause well we we should be able to build a relatively cheap a cheap remote. because well my personal opinion is is not to do Bluetooth or or radio waves, What do you think about incorporating Bluetooth or a radio receiver in the place-holder next to the T_V_, connected to the T_V_? I actually I figured that would be that would be rather nice, but then you'd still have the the infrared function.
welcome back. At the functional design meeting I had an email from the from the management board but there were four points which I think are very important. First one is they think that teletext teletext becomes outdated second one is also important the remote control shou should onl only be used for the television, so it not gonna it's not gonna be a multi-purpose remote control, second, and I think that's important for the Marketing Expert, the current customers are in the age group group of forty years and older, but with this new remote they will would like to reach a group younger than forty. I think to keep in mind, but not really for now is that they want the the the slogan and the and the logo to to be recognised more in the remote.
I have some new findings on Marketing Expert level, The method I used was giving orders to our usability lab to do a questionnaire. one hundred respondents were involved and my marketing department generated a report with a lot of results. two audiences, the first one, this scale, from sixteen to forty five age. the second one is from sixty four forty six to sixty five., as you can see here, the market share for the first audience is about sixty percent sixty five. second audience audience is thirty five percent.
You all have the the questionnaire again about the after work.
the specifi specific instructions for the next meeting you will all will receive at the the the email.
th th those things are nice. but I think that's we wel later in the stage. and well maybe we can look out if there's options that the remote in its memory can see what kinda T_V_ it is, but have the opportunity to have more options
because I think elderly people may be not used to a touch screen, and the the the the other functions, the more difficult functions to be maybe on the touch screen, but but if you display it on L_C_D_ screen with r r really big numbers You can display actual buttons on the touch screens. but well we have to look at what's our target audience. W we are aiming for younger people A touch screen, like Microsoft al already developed something like that for multi-media applications. I th I think we can do that too.
So we have now a lunch break, finally, after the lunch break it's back to individual work, once again thirty minutes. I will put my minutes so s they're updated in the shared folder too. the specifi specific instructions for the next meeting you will all will receive at the the the email. You all have the the questionnaire again about the after work.
but then with something like a touch screen could could make more menu up pop up or something. especially the important buttons, if you want to switch channel, change your volume, use teletext, it it has to work at once and more advanced options may be put it s somewhere away on the remote, behind a little little thing or a touch screen. I think the idea about touch screen is very good., because recently I saw news item on T_V_ about new telephones for elder people., they have like a touch screen with really big pictures on it like call hang-up, because one the one hand you make the remote control compatible for elder users just by scaling up the pictures or something. make a remote that fits easily in the hands then what's gonna be displayed on the touch screen? The extra functions. you you just see a menu from system functions or teletext functions, and you just choose one, Wouldn't it be better to make just one big touch screen, one one small touch screen applet and we have three of those, actually just menus with sub-menus, with or sub-items, sub-functions. then I'd like to make a proposal. If you make one big touch screen, keep the buttons always available and use the lower part of the touch screen for the rest. So you think it's will be better to have a t kinda total touch screen. that they always make the same buttons accessible, so use just for special options a part of the touch screen. an elder parents or grandparent picks up the remote from the little child and who's all in the systems functions, you'll have to have the possibility to turn off the T_V_ or to switch the channel without well using all the menu structures to get back to the primary functions. I had another idea about maybe parental control., like building in some kind of PIN code if children don't don't know the PIN code, they can't switch to violent channels or Is that possible to use or no? that actually depends
Okay. So the games are in it. The parental control will be incorporated, but it must be not too complex.
And, things like teletext, put them in the menu. But, well m my preference would to be put it in the menu structure.
But, the main concept is take one big touch screen., always display the primary buttons clear and visible. And make the menu structure changeable. One thing you've gotta keep in mind, keep the remote clear of too much functions at the same time. But, well m my preference would to be put it in the menu structure. And, things like teletext, put them in the menu.
Welcome to the conceptual design meeting, also this time there will be three presentations. And we must reach a decision on the remote control concepts., and at the end, I, when I finish it off I have some input from a master class I visited. information. I will take notes and at the end of the minutes will be at the shared folder.
But the two basic sources that I found were the best possible were the battery versus kinetic. Or you can go for both? I I prefer kinetic because it's well, the costs aren't that much higher, and, ju just a bit more high-tech than than a normal battery. Or but but you could go in a in an double curves. And that's like several different dimensions. Yeah, that gives you a younger and more high-tech look, I f I figured. Yeah you could y It leaves more space for creativity. I I ch prefer rubber because it feels Yeah.
I'll be talking about the components., what I did was I reviewed previously used items by two two different age groups. below forty five and above. senior citizens They, well, they like more the they like the traditional materials, like wood and and such more. And they like straightforward shapes. where whereas the young and dynamic, they like a more soft materials., soft and fluffy and colourful and But the two basic sources that I found were the best possible were the battery versus kinetic. Or you can go for both? But the thing is about solar panel is you have to have l light., and you you could you could use normal light, but you wouldn't get the same amount of energy that you would from a battery or something. I I prefer kinetic because it's well, the costs aren't that much higher, and, ju just a bit more high-tech than than a normal battery. But, what l what Jarek said, you could you could use a battery that you'd just keep it on the recharging whenever it moves. Or but but you could go in a in an double curves. And that's like several different dimensions. Yeah, that gives you a younger and more high-tech look, I f I figured. Yeah you could y It leaves more space for creativity. I I ch prefer rubber because it feels Yeah. Well, we discussed it in a previous meeting, so I figured I'll just leave it at the L_C_D_., you use the battery and w charge it up with kinetic. I I I would prefer both too. but if you have a square L_C_D_ screen, and you put a case around it that has like bulbs or that that covers part of the L_C_D_ screen. That's it's custom customisable and so what are the opinions? rubber or plastic?
I have a little problems with my laptop. And s s s so I had a little less time to complete., it didn't work anymore. The entire Windows
I went to Paris and Milan for some trend-watching. In Paris and Milan, we asked different people, differing in age and in income, the amount of money to spend, what they like in design and material nowadays. Our main audience, so that's people below forty, prefer the following. At first, the colours of fruit., fresh colours, green, red, strawberry red, yellow, banana yellow. Yeah. They like spongy material, Okay, our secondary audience, people above forty a forty years in age, they like the dark traditional colours. Yeah, materials like wood that They have to look fancy., they should be technological in innovative., and easy to use. We have to aim at a mu at the main audience. And, therefore use fresh colours. Here, think about removable covers, as seen in mobile telephon telephone market. To customise your own remote control., in my second sheet of personal preferences, we have to reconsider the speech function recognition. You you can see that the market is just screaming for new technologies, like speak speech recognition and stuff., building games like Snake or Tetris to amuse the younger users. And third, I stick with it, the log-in functionality with the slogan, take parental control to a new dimension.
I think we can discuss a little about the the three kind of revolutionary things Tim came with. I think that parental control is a good function to to put in the remote. How I see it is you put it on the the remote and then you have like a Windows log-on screen with parents, children. You don't want to to go down and watch the news at eight o'clock and turn it on and wait twenty seconds for for the log-on screen and then remember your code and all kinds of settings. You c may use like when there's X_P_, a simple log-on, d you just push one or two or three. I don't know if it's worth the time and effort we are going to spend on it. Well I think that's a b there's a big market for it, Just make through a remote as it is, but make an option to insert profiles, I i i if we in incorporate the parental control, let's say we do, and and well whatever, cho child just goes up to the T_V_ and presses up for instance. What m what may be better is to incorporate an a separate device that that you can program with the remote control. Okay. And what do you guys think of the games in the voice recognition? But I don't think when you're watching T_V_, hearing loud noises from the T_V_, someone screaming one, and you f the channel switches, Yeah. Yeah, like f voice recognition is too much, I think. But Okay. So the games are in it. The voice recognition are not. And the parental control are Well, I think also it's a good idea, buts very difficult to incorporate. Like the first idea from You can buy it without and with parental contr control? Or are we going to put it in and just I I figure if you had two different remotes, you could bo choose one with well a receiver in it. Well, maybe you just have to restrict it to what programs, where the parent says, you
But, what l what Jarek said, you could you could use a battery that you'd just keep it on the recharging whenever it moves., you use the battery and w charge it up with kinetic. I I I would prefer both too.
Yeah, like f voice recognition is too much, I think. But The voice recognition are not.
We have to aim at a mu at the main audience. And, therefore use fresh colours. Here, think about removable covers, as seen in mobile telephon telephone market. To customise your own remote control., in my second sheet of personal preferences, we have to reconsider the speech function recognition. You you can see that the market is just screaming for new technologies, like speak speech recognition and stuff., building games like Snake or Tetris to amuse the younger users. And third, I stick with it, the log-in functionality with the slogan, take parental control to a new dimension.
They have to look fancy., they should be technological in innovative., and easy to use.
N, next meeting starts in thirty minutes. the the industrial development centre and user interface will work together on a prototype. And will drawing it on the SMARTboard. And, the marketing expert will will ke he will be keeping busy with the product evaluation. But the most specific instructions will be sent to you by email. But I think it was a very very good session, gentlemen. But keep an eye on your laptops for a real
I had a I had another idea to put the whole the whole idea of Real Reaction and a single brand and that kind of thing. When you put on remote, you see a kind of a just like when you telephone, you see a little animation. And with the with the with the motto, we put fashion in electronics. Well, if you if you have the l L_C_D_ screen, you can you can have a small logo i at the bottom. That spins around like all the time. It it's just like a globe in Internet Explorer.
I went to a master class and two things are are can come in handy for us. First thing is we talked about knowledge management. Knowledge engineering and the fact that that that the idea of knowledge, sharing and learning knowledge from other companies is like that. It's it's very hot at the moment, so it's it's mostly for the management expert to to look what other What other companies had to also with the the the the marketing campaign when they put on a newer remote, just some Yeah. Import export.
How I see it is you put it on the the remote and then you have like a Windows log-on screen with parents, children. You don't want to to go down and watch the news at eight o'clock and turn it on and wait twenty seconds for for the log-on screen and then remember your code and all kinds of settings. You c may use like when there's X_P_, a simple log-on, d you just push one or two or three. I don't know if it's worth the time and effort we are going to spend on it. Well I think that's a b there's a big market for it, Just make through a remote as it is, but make an option to insert profiles, I i i if we in incorporate the parental control, let's say we do, and and well whatever, cho child just goes up to the T_V_ and presses up for instance. What m what may be better is to incorporate an a separate device that that you can program with the remote control. Well, I think also it's a good idea, buts very difficult to incorporate. And the parental control are Like the first idea from You can buy it without and with parental contr control? Or are we going to put it in and just I I figure if you had two different remotes, you could bo choose one with well a receiver in it. Well, maybe you just have to restrict it to what programs, where the parent says, you cannot watch channel seven, nine, and ten, and you cannot watch all channels after ten o'clock. But you still have the problem about the television itself. You could just blame it on television and make it their problem.
The parental control will be incorporated, but it must be not too complex.
Well, we discussed it in a previous meeting, so I figured I'll just leave it at the L_C_D_. The buttons will be touch-screen. but there may not be too many buttons.
I I I prefer rubber. The case will be double-curved and rubber, in a fr flashy fruity colour that with cover is removable.
I I I would prefer both too., you use the battery and w charge it up with kinetic. Okay. So I think we have decided on the things that from Janus, the energy, the combination between battery and kinetic.
the the industrial development centre and user interface will work together on a prototype. And will drawing it on the SMARTboard. And, the marketing expert will will ke he will be keeping busy with the product evaluation.
now it's about time to talk about this project. was there room for creativity in our meetings or in your individual meetings? But, that's mainly because of the information that was delivered to us. I I didn't think so. That there was a lot of room for it. and I couldn't go on on i on the internet and search my own stuff. Bu Well, I th I think you two, especially you and and Daniel, you d you you both had the less creative roles in the project. I think Jeroen and I, we had a more design we could have more we had more room for creativity than than you two. how about the leadership? I thought the first meeting was a little bit of unstructured meeting. but you could have structure it a l little bit more. So like, I I was talking most of the time the first meeting meeting, and I was a I was also very unhappy, very unsatisfied about the and I think the the last two meetings also we we reached some good decisions about talk Yeah, more more consensus. No, it you did better., teamwork? Well, we work together on a project, but everybody has his own task. and it's wo more like presentation and some points were discussed. But, really teamwork were you two Nah. Yeah, we we had some trouble with the pen, but D just write your name right now. he he knows how it works, yeah. The idea is great, but it doesn't work properly. It's it's not real real use for me. I it's the same concept as the pen, where you f have to download the software or s very slow. Be it it takes a lot of time to draw things and to write things, And the eraser was another problem. M Abo What kind of new ideas? Well, the the idea of the touch-screen is New ideas about the working of this software, about about the project, about the remote controls or I don't know what what I mean. People will still feel the
Well, I th I think you two, especially you and and Daniel, you d you you both had the less creative roles in the project. I think Jeroen and I, we had a more design we could have more we had more room for creativity than than you two. Well, we work together on a project, but everybody has his own task. and it's wo more like presentation and some points were discussed. But, really teamwork were you two
I thought the first meeting was a little bit of unstructured meeting. but you could have structure it a l little bit more. So like, I I was talking most of the time the first meeting meeting, and I was a I was also very unhappy, very unsatisfied about the and I think the the last two meetings also we we reached some good decisions about talk Yeah, more more consensus. No, it you did better.
And and for colours, we we figured starting with basic colours like white or metallic grey. Those are the technological colours actually, It would be best to to appeal to a broad public and make the covers exchangeable, so the young people will buy an orange and a red and blue and a purple, but when the o older people go in the shop and they see an orange remote control, it would be less appealing than a white one. And young people, we think, are a little bit more flexible, they think, I'll buy for a couple of Euros some noi nice hip Maybe it's an idea to sell it without a cover, so that you can pick a cover in the in the shop. I think a cover is necessary, So, there must be some cheap standard cover, Yeah, but you d you mustn't forget that our target aim is younger people. So I think it will be a better idea to have some flashy fruity colours as as a standard, and for the people who really want a more sophisticated, more traditional look, they're willing to pay that. Yeah. Yeah, maybe yeah, perhaps you're right., maybe we could develop a cover with wood style. a wood style, a white c and a couple of h hip fruity colours. And lea l delivered standard with a fruity colour, but not too not too much. But, the mai I think th the standard must be some kind of attractive flashy colours. Not too, but w a little,
, now is the time to evaluate our prototype concept to to the past requirements., we're going to do that with a seven point scale. We have to be consensive about about things. We're going to vote. The remote control is designed for people with age below forty. Yeah, it's not just designed for people under the age of forty. It's also designed for people above forty. Yeah, two or three, The remote control is beautiful. acco according to us, it's one? Or Of c of course you have to be very positive and enthusiastic about your own product., the remote control looks fancy. One? The remote control has big, clear channel switching buttons. Yeah yeah,, teletext buttons and volume buttons? Teletext is in the menu. Volume is true. Yeah, the they are big and clear.. I would give it a more a five or a six. The remote control is easy to be found. well, when we put in fancy colours, yeah Yeah, it has these all these fruity colours and it has a strange shape. If you put your normal remote control under your bed, or you throw this remote control under your bed, is it better findable? It'll make a difference. Well, we p we can do it glow in the dark. Because four is between three and also between between true and false., w according to the the other remote controls, there may be there in your T_V_ room, this one will stand out, I think. if this lying on your couch, you're you're you think what's that for kinda orange thing. If your fifteen remotes in a drawer, you find it, yeah? But but the survey under users was that they really lost it. Yeah, that's stupid. Most of times when you lose it you're sitting on it. the remote control has fresh, fruity colours. I would call choose two, 'cause we decided not to make two f fresh colours, as it would not. Yeah, yeah, not too flashy. The remote control is made of soft material. Yeah, rubber, is kind of soft. Yeah, but not
Okay, we have now to c to calculate the production cost. Yeah, if the costs are under twelve and a half Euro, then we can ra move on to the project evaluation, as we have experienced it. Otherwise, we have do have to do a little redesign thingy. So Kinetic, one. Battery, yes. One. Advanced chip. So it's only once double-curved. We're now in a problem, 'cause we have reached eleven Euro yet. Then we'll see we'll we'll see wha how much we are over budget. Special is the special colour? Yeah, but we want to make the wood colours, that No, this is a standard colour. Yes, this is a special colour. Yeah, if if you're honest, we'll type one, special colour. Yeah, but but D but Daniel, tha that's that's another brand. That's another article Well, we're only four Euro over budget.
Well, we're only four Euro over budget. Well, other case, we can make it single-curved or uncurved., single-curves. The kinetic thing, can we just skip it, because you have to shake it, but that's not really innovative. What do you think about putting a battery in it, but also selling like the covers, a docking station But you can use rechargeable batteries anyway, just you s you have to recharge them manual. well you you can go from double-curved to single-curved. so we have to bake the ba back flat, and then No, it's it's just one curve and not a back curved I think. Or but it's its' well it's it's r it is the main point of the the the the look. No advanced chip, that's a little bit of problem. So, if we do this, we're on twelve and a half Euro., there's an a a athe aesthetic value, but not functionality. If you make it double-curved, it costs one Euro more. But I don't know if twelve and a half is a fixed fixed price. Yeah, well let's assume it is. But I I figured that the kinetic would be a marketing promotion. No, well, y I mean, y you can go into your neighbour and tell him, ha, my k remote control is kinetic. Yeah, but it doesn't fit in our co cost profile. So because if you want to go to kinetic, you're you're on thirteen and a half and you must go to flat, and I think now it's it's more of a compromise Well, we were above, so we did a little redesign
, once again I'm gonna take minutes., first we have a prototype presentation by G_ and G_. evaluation crit criteria., in combination with the finance I I received a an an Excel file which we have to fill in later on., and then we must see if we stay under the twelve and a half Euro. And after that, an evaluation of the process how we how we have done it here with the SMARTboard, with the with our laptops, with the all all this. Once again, forty minutes,
Nah. Yeah, we we had some trouble with the pen, but D just write your name right now. he he knows how it works, yeah. The idea is great, but it doesn't work properly. It's it's not real real use for me. I it's the same concept as the pen, where you f have to download the software or s very slow. Be it it takes a lot of time to draw things and to write things,
I would g give the word to G_ and G_ for the prototype presentation. Shall I give a short introduction and then Yeah, well sure., this was our first concept. We decided to use a single touch-screen. And, well, we began with with a form of shape, that is is easy to hold w in one hand, left or right handed. well, during the meeting I showed you the concept of placing the buttons on top, usable with your thumb, and the menu structure, if necessary, with your other hand, Yeah, well, and as you saw, we would just have the basic remote with the panel L_C_D_ screen. Well, these would be the main buttons, h you could change them later on in your own profile if you want to. We have the more advanced menu setting right here. We have the sub-menus and stu stuff. As you can see, this there, there are two weird bumps in it. This is for the added effect of well y youth and dynamic. And so when you put it on the table, it will just lay down. The s panel we g you would hide with some more rubber layers, But the overlaying layer is a little bit curved and stuff. you can make a more thinner design, So, you have room here for your battery S and you can just be the the layer of the touchscreen and some have some wires underneath it to make it as thin as possible in the middle for good grip., you can see there's a v a very youthful dynamic exterior. it's like an Easter egg. Yeah, it's like an e but this is for children. We we want a more adult version. So this actually basic the idea. We we just want to build a more adult vers adult version of of this.
because there must be some kind of end report. about all the meetings, what we have decided, here is standing whoa, we can celebrate now, but the end report is You have now ten minutes left to finish up the end report. Maybe we can do it together. So I I s I will put it on a story-board., this is about the functional design, but you can save it u the under another name. It's a read-only version. about the three functions where which are most used and which must immediately be visible on our remote control., it must be simple to use, very clear what to do, and at the younger people. No, you have to put, switch channels at the top, because that's the most used function and teletext at the second a volume changing, second. S switch, yes. then the conceptual design. Well, okay, maybe you can add it later that we decided in the end because of the cost., he here it is still double-curve, the rubber, the flashy, the fruity, the removable. It's not double. Nay but that this is what Was initial, the plan. The initial plan. And the the added functions like Tetris snake, the added functions., was it included in the cost? I don't think so,? Okay, so anybody misses something here about Yeah, the end conclusion. that's that's what I'm gonna write b between now. Yeah, but but the the decisions are put in the conclusion, I think. well I gonna redesign something now. Oh, before you change anything maybe you save it first. Finish meeting now. I'm going to finish my end report.
that's that's what I'm gonna write b between now. I'm going to finish my end report.
And lea l delivered standard with a fruity colour, but not too not too much. But, the mai I think th the standard must be some kind of attractive flashy colours. So I think it will be a better idea to have some flashy fruity colours as as a standard, and for the people who really want a more sophisticated, more traditional look, they're willing to pay that.
, single-curves. well you you can go from double-curved to single-curved.
The kinetic thing, can we just skip it, because you have to shake it, but that's not really innovative.
Well, we're only four Euro over budget.
Well, other case, we can make it single-curved or uncurved., single-curves. The kinetic thing, can we just skip it, because you have to shake it, but that's not really innovative. What do you think about putting a battery in it, but also selling like the covers, a docking station But you can use rechargeable batteries anyway, just you s you have to recharge them manual. well you you can go from double-curved to single-curved. so we have to bake the ba back flat, and then No, it's it's just one curve and not a back curved I think. Or but it's its' well it's it's r it is the main point of the the the the look. No advanced chip, that's a little bit of problem. If you make it double-curved, it costs one Euro more., there's an a a athe aesthetic value, but not functionality. But I don't know if twelve and a half is a fixed fixed price. Yeah, well let's assume it is. But I I figured that the kinetic would be a marketing promotion. No, well, y I mean, y you can go into your neighbour and tell him, ha, my k remote control is kinetic. Yeah, but it doesn't fit in our co cost profile. So because if you want to go to kinetic, you're you're on thirteen and a half and you must go to flat, and I think now it's it's more of a compromise
I I didn't think so. That there was a lot of room for it. But, that's mainly because of the information that was delivered to us. and I couldn't go on on i on the internet and search my own stuff. Bu Well, I th I think you two, especially you and and Daniel, you d you you both had the less creative roles in the project. I think Jeroen and I, we had a more design we could have more we had more room for creativity than than you two. Well, we work together on a project, but everybody has his own task. and it's wo more like presentation and some points were discussed. But, really teamwork were you two
Nah. Yeah, we we had some trouble with the pen, but D just write your name right now. he he knows how it works, yeah. The idea is great, but it doesn't work properly. It's it's not real real use for me. I it's the same concept as the pen, where you f have to download the software or s very slow. Be it it takes a lot of time to draw things and to write things,
